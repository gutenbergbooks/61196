</div>

<p class='c005'>The present volume is the third work published by the
Yale University Press on the Williams Memorial Publication
Fund. This Foundation was established June 15, 1916,
by a gift made to Yale University by Dr. George C. F.
Williams, of Hartford, a member of the Class of 1878, Yale
School of Medicine, where three generations of his family
studied—his father, Dr. William Cook Williams, in the
Class of 1850, and his grandfather, Dr. William Chauncey
Williams, in the Class of 1822.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>This work is in the main a continuation of the volume
entitled “The Growth of Medicine,” but it is also intended
to serve as an amplification of the latter part of that work,
which, owing to various circumstances that were in large
measure beyond my control, lacked completeness. The most
troublesome of these adverse circumstances was the fact
that I had failed, during a recent visit to Europe, to find
those sources of trustworthy information upon which alone
such a narrative could properly be based; and later still,
when I made my first attempts to construct the text of the
present volume, I again encountered the same kind of obstacles,
but in an even greater degree, and was then strongly
disposed to abandon the undertaking altogether. At this
juncture of affairs, however, I was much surprised and
pleased to receive from Mrs. Charles F. Norton, the librarian
of Transylvania College at Lexington, Ky., a letter in
which she stated that the college had in its possession a
large collection of medical works which had been purchased
at Paris, France, in 1819, at which period of its history the
institution bore the title of Transylvania University and
possessed a flourishing medical department; and that the
president of the institution would be happy to extend to me
every possible facility for utilizing this great mass of historical
material. Shortly afterwards, in reply to my request
that I might be furnished with a partial list of the books
contained in this collection, in order that I might determine
how many of them related to the period in the history of
French medicine in which I was at that time particularly
interested,—the period, mainly, from about 1760 to 1830,—I
received a card catalogue of the titles of over 100 French,
English and Latin treatises. This information removed all
doubts from my mind concerning the wisdom of my visiting
Lexington, and I accordingly signified my prompt acceptance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>of the cordial invitations extended to me by President
Crossfield.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I write these lines I am prompted to add the further
statement that during my stay at Lexington, which covered
a period of seven months, I received every assistance from
the Transylvania College authorities that I could possibly
desire; and in particular I wish to express my deep sense of
gratitude to the librarian, Mrs. Norton, for the interest
which she manifested in my work and for the valuable assistance
which she rendered in hastening its completion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cuvier, the celebrated naturalist, in a memoir which he
read before the Royal Institute of France, makes the following
statement: “It is not through a perusal of the insufficient
extracts that are commonly made from the published
works of distinguished men, nor through the incomplete
indications which the recital of their discoveries may furnish,
that we derive the greatest pleasure from the eulogies
pronounced after the death of these men. This desirable
result is more likely to be obtained when we are made intimately
acquainted with their individual traits of character,—when
we are, so to speak, permitted to know these
men in a social way; when we are given the opportunity of
contemplating, close at hand, their distinct qualities, their
virtues, yes, even their faults,—provided the facts are
plainly stated by one who is skilled in such portraiture.
Furthermore, the reader is sure to derive the greatest pleasure,
and also to be the most benefited, when every page of
the eulogy furnishes evidence of the genuine happiness and
wonderful serenity which characterize the lives of those
who devote themselves to the culture of the sciences. Compare
these men with those who have been intent on securing
glory through devastating the world, and note how frequently
they live to be septuagenarians or even octogenarians.”
Deeply impressed by the wisdom of the advice thus
briefly given by the celebrated French naturalist, I have
striven, in the following chapters, to act upon it as circumstances
might permit.</p>

<p class='c007'>After making several unsuccessful attempts to classify
my chapters according to the special fields in which the different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>men attained distinction, I came to the conclusion
that the difficulties which stand in the way of adopting such
a classification are well-nigh insurmountable; and chief
among these difficulties may be mentioned the fact that
many of the leading physicians attained distinction in two
or more different fields. Botany, for example, was frequently
combined with anatomy and surgery; chemistry
with physiology; and so on. On the whole, therefore, it
seemed better to rest satisfied, wherever this was found to
be practicable, with the simple subdivision according to
geographical districts—viz., Northern and Central Germany,
Austria, Italy, France, Switzerland and England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relatively few Americans who played an important
part in advancing the science and art of medicine during
the latter half of the eighteenth century and the early part
of the nineteenth make it preferable, as it seems to me, to
omit all reference to them in the present work, leaving to
the writer of a volume devoted to modern medicine, the duty
of honoring their achievements.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Prefatory Remarks.</i>—As the present volume purports to
deal with events that occurred chiefly during the eighteenth
century, the reader may think it strange that I should introduce
here a sketch which relates to a physician whose life
covers a period nearly one century earlier. My reason for
departing, in this instance, from the proper chronological
order, in the arrangement of my text, is of a twofold nature.
In the first place, I did not discover Gilles de la Tourette’s
interesting memoir—almost the only satisfactory source of
information available concerning Renaudot—until about
February 1, 1918—that is, nearly one year after “The
Growth of Medicine” had been published; and, second, on
looking over the principal treatises on the history of medicine,
I failed to find any adequate account of the remarkable
work accomplished by Renaudot. Puschmann, so far
as I have been able to learn, is the only authority who gives
this great philanthropist due credit for the important part
which he played in reflecting honor upon our profession.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Théophraste Renaudot</span> was born at Loudon, a small
town in Western France, picturesquely situated on a high
hill about thirty miles northwest of Poitiers. His parents,
who were wealthy Protestants, died while he was still a
mere lad. Théophraste, who inherited the entire fortune
left by his parents, developed at a remarkably early age
strong humanitarian ideas, and it was under the stimulus of
these that he shaped his course in life. With a clear idea of
the kind of training that would best fit him for the work
which he proposed to undertake, he decided to study medicine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>as this career, better than any other, would enable him
to accomplish his purpose. Accordingly he went to Montpellier,
took the regular course of instruction in the university,
and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1606,
before he had reached his twentieth year. Recognizing the
fact that a physician should be of a certain age before he
can reasonably expect to command the confidence of his
fellowmen, he decided to utilize the time following his graduation
in visiting some of the more important capitals of
Europe. The first country which he visited was Italy, where
he undoubtedly gained some familiarity with the manner in
which the <i>monts-de-piété</i> (the prototypes of our modern
pawnbrokers’ shops) were managed under the guiding control
of the popes. It is also highly probable that he visited
in turn the universities of Holland and Belgium as well as
the two great English universities—Oxford and Cambridge.
Then, upon his return to France, he went to Paris and began
the study of chemistry at the Collège de Saint-Côme. During
his stay in the French metropolis, he was made painfully
aware of the prevalence of poverty, the streets being
filled everywhere with shameless beggars, and Hôtel-Dieu,
the great city hospital, being overcrowded with the sick,
among whom were large numbers of children affected with
contagious diseases and infants starving to death from lack
of wet-nurses. The first thought that occurred to the practical
mind of Renaudot was to find work for many of these
poor people; but when he set about doing this he at once
encountered many obstacles; and finally, in despair over his
lack of success, was forced to abandon further efforts in
this direction and return to his home in Loudon. While
there, he frequently met the influential Capucin Monk
Leclerc du Tremblay, commonly known as his “Gray Eminence,”
and through him he was brought to the notice of
Cardinal Richelieu, then or soon afterward, Secretary of
State of Marie de Médicis, the queen-mother of Louis XIII.
Although the cardinal, for political reasons, antagonized
the Huguenots, he personally entertained no unfriendly
feelings toward men of the Protestant faith, and consequently
he was quite prepared to aid Renaudot when he laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>before him, as he did shortly after his return to Paris, his
schemes for the betterment of the poor in that great city.
One of these schemes called for the establishment of a
“<i>bureau d’adresse ou de rencontre</i>,” an office depot where,
by the payment of three sous, anybody was entitled to have
the address of his place of business entered upon the registers
of the bureau; and where also employer and employee
might meet for arranging terms. If any person wished to
learn the address of any given place of business, the desired
information would be furnished upon the payment of a fee
of the same value; but <i>no charge whatever was to be made
in the case of a poor person</i>. This scheme proved a complete
success in a very short time. Then, as a further step in the
development of his <i>bureau</i>, Renaudot joined what he termed
“<i>ventes à grâce troque ou rachapt</i>”—that is, “sales with
the privilege of exchange or redemption.” This was the
first step toward the establishment of his “<i>mont-de-piété</i>,”
an institution which was not fully organized by him at Paris
until 1637. The tax upon loans was fixed at 3 per cent—just
enough to pay the expenses of running the bureau.
His motto was: “Loan money without expectation of
profit.” His solution of the social problem was summed up
in the following aphorism: “In every organized community
or state the rich shall afford aid to the poor, all harmony
between the two classes ceasing when one of them grows
richer at the expense of the other.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At the time when Renaudot came to Paris, there existed
no such thing as the “<i>Journal</i>”—that is, a printed periodical
such as he contemplated and afterward founded. At an
interview with Cardinal Richelieu, the Secretary of State
of Louis XIII., Renaudot proposed that all the news received
from the outside world, the king’s edicts, and treaties
made with other nations should be brought together and
published at stated intervals in a single printed sheet. The
cardinal at once saw how important the proposed journal
would be for his own interest, especially if its management
were intrusted to a man who agreed with him in regard to
political questions. Then, in addition, the mere fact that
it was an official sheet, the only strictly French periodical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>would be of special value at that moment, when the princes
of the blood were forming alliances with the enemy. So, on
May 30, 1631, Louis XIII. granted to Renaudot “the privilege
to make, print and sell, through any agent whom he
might select and wherever it seemed to him best to sell
copies, the news, the official appointments and accounts of
all events occurring both within and outside the kingdom.”
The first number of the “<i>Gazette de France</i>”—which was
the name that Renaudot gave to his periodical—appeared
on the day mentioned above. The price at which this sheet
of four pages sold was two <i>liards</i>.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One year later, the size of the Gazette was increased by
the addition of four separate pages which bore the title,
“<i>Nouvelles</i>,” and simultaneously the price of the entire
journal (8 pages) was increased to one sou. It is scarcely
necessary to state that the Gazette was directly inspired by
Richelieu, and that even the king occasionally took a hand
in editing it. Gilles de la Tourette, the author of the memoir
from which I have compiled the present brief sketch, says
that he examined all the issues of the Gazette from 1631 to
1653 but failed to find in them a single <i>réclame</i>—advertisement
or editorial puff.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the very day on which it was first published, the
Gazette proved a brilliant success. I should have mentioned,
at the beginning of this sketch, the fact that for a
certain length of time Renaudot contributed liberally from
his own funds toward the support of his pet schemes of
benevolence, but it does not appear, in the account given
by de la Tourette, whether the Gazette enterprise should
not be counted as one of these schemes. At the same time,
the thought naturally suggests itself that this physician’s
motive in advocating the publishing of an official newspaper
like the Gazette was probably a strong desire to win for
his humanitarian schemes the strong support which the
Cardinal and the King would be able to grant. Whether this
be true or not, the idea of creating an official newspaper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>under the protection of the highest authority in France certainly
showed far-sighted wisdom on the part of Renaudot.
In 1640,—<i>i.e.</i>, nine years after the founding of the Gazette
as an official dispenser of political and civic news,—Renaudot
changed its scope by adding to it the character of a
medical journal. After 1640, therefore, the Gazette may
rightly be classed as representing the first attempt to publish
a medical periodical in France.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Another important feature was added by Renaudot to his
philanthropic scheme in this same year 1640. He obtained
from the King a decree authorizing him to establish a
“<i>Bureau de Consultations Charitables pour les Pauvres
Malades</i>.” The manner in which this Bureau was to be conducted
may be briefly explained in the following words. At
certain fixed hours fifteen physicians, all of them friends
of the founder, and a smaller number of apothecaries presented
themselves at the Bureau, where, seated at a few
separate tables, the physicians listened to the statements
made by the poor people who had come there in the hope of
obtaining relief from their maladies. In the simpler cases,
a single physician was fully equal to the task of prescribing
whatever the patient’s condition called for, but in those of
a more obscure nature, two or three of the physicians present
joined in a consultation. After the question of a suitable
treatment had been decided, one of the apothecaries in
attendance prepared the remedy or remedies which had been
prescribed, and at the same time a written statement of the
diagnosis was handed to the patient. If the ailment happened
to be of a surgical nature, the measures required for
its treatment were carried out on the spot. Some of the
patients who presented themselves at the Bureau were
easily able to pay for professional advice; and, when such a
person appeared, an opportunity was afforded for dropping
into a suitable box the fee which he or she was disposed to
give. This money was utilized in paying for the remedies
furnished the poor. In exceptional cases, it was perfectly
evident that drugs alone could not afford the desired relief;
the need was rather for more and better food. Fully realizing
this need, and acting under his strongly benevolent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>impulses, Renaudot not infrequently placed money in the
hands of these suffering dispensary patients when they were
about to return to their homes. The exact amount of these
gifts is not known, but they must in the aggregate have been
large; for his biographer says that, in addition to the sums
which his more prosperous patients placed in his hands for
the benefit of the poor, he contributed annually out of his
own purse, toward the maintenance of these free consultations,
the sum of 2,000 livres (the “livre” being of about
the same value as the franc). The success of the Bureau
was so great that in the course of a few months it became
necessary that a certain number of physicians should be at
the consulting rooms of the institution at all times during
the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a natural result of this increase in the Bureau’s popularity
the celebrity of Renaudot also increased, until it extended
to every part of the kingdom; and, as a further
result, the institution itself now began to take on the character
of a school for clinical instruction—an entirely new
feature; for at that period no facilities of this kind were
provided by the Paris Faculty of Medicine. When Renaudot
observed this new and unexpected development of the
work carried on at the Bureau he petitioned the King for
permission to erect, at his own expense, in the Faubourg St.
Antoine, the most populous quarter of the City of Paris, a
“<i>Hostel des Consultations Charitables</i>”—in other words,
a free hospital for the poor.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Up to the year 1638 Renaudot had got along very amicably
with the Paris Faculty. He had often consulted with
them and he had entered the names of his two sons, Isaac
and Eusebius, as students at the medical school. Furthermore,
there could not have existed any prejudice against
him on religious grounds as—upon the advice of Richelieu
and Father Joseph (Leclerc du Tremblay, or “His Gray
Eminence”)—his two sons had been educated in the Roman
Catholic faith. It appears, however, that these favorable
considerations were not strong enough to prevent professional
jealousy, on the part of the Paris physicians, from
setting to work to undermine all Renaudot’s good work.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The real truth—viz., that the newcomer’s success was
robbing them of some of their paying practice—was not
confessed by these men openly, but instead they objected to
his having, with the King’s permission (granted in 1640),
established furnaces for the manufacture of chemical remedies.
They also claimed that he was injuring the profession
of medicine through his doctrine that good effects were
obtainable from the employment of both opium and antimony
as internal remedies, and also through his maintenance
of the new doctrine (1616) of the circulation of the
blood. Were not these professional sins, they claimed,
sufficiently heinous to justify them in summoning him before
the magistrates as an impostor? They believed that they
were fully justified in so doing; and accordingly they proceeded
without further delay to bring suit against Renaudot.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would require much additional space to furnish here
even a condensed account of the events which characterized
this disgraceful attack by the Paris Faculty—and especially
by Guy Patin, who was at that time its Dean—against
Renaudot, and I have therefore no hesitation in omitting
all but one or two further details of this part of Renaudot’s
history. In the first place, Cardinal Richelieu and the King
stood firmly by Renaudot to the very end; and, on July 14,
1641, the King’s Council condemned the Faculty on all
points of their charge, and in this manner granted complete
authorization to Renaudot’s work. He himself, notwithstanding
the great victory which he had won over his unscrupulous
enemies, all of them physicians of high social
position, resumed his efforts to win them over to a friendly
attitude—not toward himself individually, but toward the
benevolent schemes which he was doing his best to establish
on a firm footing. All his efforts, however, toward pacification
proved of no avail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long afterward Renaudot’s two sons, both of whom
had by this time completed the regular course of studies at
the Medical Schools, made a respectful request to the
Faculty for permission to appear before them for the
examination to which all candidates for the degree of
Doctor of Medicine were obliged to submit. In the meantime,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>as if to show his approval of the request which Renaudot’s
sons had made, Richelieu had taken Eusebius with him
as his physician-in-ordinary when he joined Louis XIII.
at the seat of war in the southern part of France. But
neither this kindly act on the part of the Cardinal, nor any
of the other efforts made by Renaudot’s friends in behalf
of his two sons, seemed to make any impression upon the
Faculty. They refused point blank to grant the desired
opportunity for an examination. As a last resort, Isaac
appealed to Parliament “to issue a decree to the effect that
the Faculty of Medicine must confer the degree of M.D. on
both Isaac and Eusebius Renaudot <i>within fifteen days</i>; and
declaring that, if the decree should not be obeyed within the
prescribed limits of time, the decree itself should serve as
full equivalent for the title in question.” The Faculty duly
entered the decree upon their registers, but in secret they
determined that the two Renaudot brothers should be excluded
from all their official meetings. Théophraste Renaudot
protested and the Faculty of the University of Montpellier
pleaded warmly in his behalf, but it was of no avail.
After the death of Richelieu the Paris Faculty had no
difficulty in thwarting nearly all the excellent schemes of
Renaudot. He was obliged to abandon the plan of building,
at his own expense, a hospital, and his two sons were not
permitted to practice medicine in Paris. He continued,
however, to edit the Gazette up to the time of his death
in 1653.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gilles de la Tourette, in his interesting memoir, makes the
following reflection upon the career of this pioneer journalist:—“All
the innocent inventions of this benefactor of
humanity are prospering to-day. In addition to his plan
for building a hospital, he was the first to organize the whole
scheme of Public Assistance—viz., charitable consultations
(not unlike our dispensary work) and gratuitous visits at
the residences of the poor. And, in addition to these, he
introduced the <i>Monts-de-Piété</i> into Paris and also his
Bureau of Addresses of exchange and redemption. To this
man whose guiding maxim was ‘Lend money to the poor
without expecting any return,’ posterity owes some reparation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and I hope that soon it will be possible to erect in one
of our public squares a monument that will perpetuate the
memory of the greatest philanthropist of the seventeenth
century.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>LOW STATE OF MEDICAL AFFAIRS IN GERMANY
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY</p>
<p class='c005'>The intellectual activity of Germany was very low during
the first half of the eighteenth century, and this statement
applies with equal truth to all the departments of learning.
It was only at the time of the French Revolution and for a
few months previous to this period that the signs of an
awakening began to show themselves. The prevailing
unrest and turmoil in the political world are commonly
assumed to have furnished ample cause for this widespread
intellectual inactivity; and yet, on the other hand, it is conceivable
that it was these very disturbances in the domain
of politics which had the effect of stimulating the marked
increase in mental activity which soon followed. This
certainly seems to have been true of general literature, for
it was toward the end of the period named that what are
admitted to be the classical works of German authors—for
instance, the writings of Klopstock, Lessing, Herder, Gellert,
Wieland, Goethe, Schiller and the philosopher Kant—were
first published. In medicine, says August Hirsch, one
of the leading German historical authorities, other influences,
beside those of a political nature, contributed powerfully
toward the advancement of the science of medicine.
The medical students and the younger practitioners, according
to his statements, began at this period to show evidences
of a wish to become more learned in things relating to their
calling and to possess greater refinement in their manners
and habits. Trips were made by them more and more frequently
to the leading cities of France, Italy and England
for the purpose of acquiring additional knowledge of medical
science. Thus, little by little, the medical profession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Germany gained increased standing and respect from the
community. Beginning with Prussia the governments of
the different German states, one after the other, established
examinations for the purpose of determining the fitness of
the applicants for the right to practice medicine. Then,
following the example of their rulers, members of the aristocracy
adopted the practice of taking a physician with
them on their travels, and the wish to be chosen for this
privileged office acted upon the younger physicians as a
decided stimulus to acquire greater skill and knowledge.
Thus gradually the family physician, in many instances,
came to be considered an adviser of greater importance than
the clergyman. Then, beside, the knowledge that he had
acquired this increased power and that he was held in
greater esteem by society, reacted upon the physician’s
character, rendering him more and more ambitious to excel
and to deserve confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>While, during the earlier part of the eighteenth century,
medical affairs in Northern and Central Germany were in
the condition described above, there was taking place at
Vienna, the capital of Austria, the most effective revival of
medical science of which we possess any record. Of this
important event, however, I will say nothing further at
present. A reasonably full account will be found in one of
the later chapters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although I have spoken of the early and middle portions
of the eighteenth century as constituting a barren or stagnant
period in the history of medicine, I would not wish to
convey to my readers the impression that it was a colorless
and uneventful period. Far from it. There was nothing
colorless, for example, in Hahnemann’s eventful career,
and yet to all appearances he was not contributing in any
way to the genuine and solid advance of the science of
medicine. Then, again, Hufeland is not commonly supposed
to have contributed in any material degree to the advance
of medical science, and yet his “<i>Makrobiotik</i>,” his “Art of
Prolonging Life,” is a veritable mine of useful information
that the practitioner of medicine can scarcely afford to
classify as trivial. Hufeland also deserves the credit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>having founded one of the earliest medical journals, a
periodical which still, in many of its numbers that were
issued during the later years of the eighteenth century,
furnishes reading matter that to-day possesses the power to
entertain even a twentieth-century reader. At a somewhat
later date (1779) J. Peter Frank founded the first journal
or archives distinctly devoted to hygiene and medico-legal
science. Farther on I will supply a few details concerning
these two rather important contributions to medical
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, there are a few men who, during this same relatively
barren period of German medical science, made
permanently valuable contributions to our stock of knowledge.
Among these stands out conspicuously Johann
Christian Reil (1759–1813). Although lack of space prevents
me from doing anything like full justice to these
worthy representatives of our profession, I will endeavor
to furnish in the next chapter at least sufficient information
concerning their work and characters to enable the reader
to place them in their proper niches in the history of
medicine.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>PHYSICIANS WHO ATTAINED DISTINCTION IN
SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF MEDICINE
DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY</p>
<p class='c005'>In looking over the list of medical men who attained distinction
during the first half of the eighteenth century, one
can scarcely fail to note two important facts, viz., that they
hailed from widely separated localities in Western Europe,—for
example, from England, Holland, Northern Germany,
France, Austria, Switzerland and Italy,—and also that the
advances which they effected in medical knowledge were
not confined to one or two departments of this science but
included very nearly all the fundamental branches. Hence
it could not rightly be claimed by a citizen of any one of
these countries that his own nation was entitled to be considered
the leader in this advance. It would be a waste of
time, and would require more space than can be spared for
such a purpose, to furnish here even an incomplete list of
the anatomists, biologists, chemists, pharmacologists, diagnosticians,
therapeutists and surgeons who during the
period named took a very active part in the work. Probably
Boerhaave of the University of Leyden, Holland, of
whose career I have given some account in the preceding
volume, deserves to be reckoned one of the first physicians
who exerted a strong stimulating influence upon the movement
as a whole. From a superficial examination of his
writings the modern physician finds it difficult to understand
why Boerhaave attained so great a degree of popularity
as he indisputably did,—a popularity, too, which was
of the best sort; for during the period of his professorship
both students and practicing physicians flocked to Leyden
from all parts of Europe, and they never tired of speaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>about the great benefit which they derived from Boerhaave’s
teaching. Many of them attributed this popularity
more especially to his practice—which at that time was a
novelty—of laying great stress upon bedside teaching and
upon the importance of studying disease from direct observation
of its manifestations in the living subject. Then, in
addition, there is evidence that, as a teacher, Boerhaave
undoubtedly possessed the gift of exerting a personal charm
upon his auditors.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Not a few of those who were privileged to receive instruction
from this celebrated physician became themselves distinguished
afterward as teachers or authors, and thus Boerhaave’s
method of teaching was perpetuated. Among the
physicians to whom reference has just been made were such
men as Albrecht von Haller, of Berne, Switzerland, Van
Swieten, of Vienna, and Hoffmann, of Halle, Prussian Saxony,
many of whom are well known to-day in a general way
to students of the history of medicine, but who, nevertheless,
in at least a few instances, are worthy of having their
careers described in further detail. In the following pages
I propose to supply biographical sketches of these men and
to show in what respects they exerted a beneficial influence
upon the great body of their confrères, and also to what
extent they made contributions to the science of medicine in
its various branches.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will undoubtedly surprise some of my readers, as it
did me, to learn that during the comparatively barren
period of the eighteenth century, to which brief reference
has been made on a previous page, there were in Northern
and Central Germany several anatomists and biologists who
did creditable work as original investigators in these departments
of medicine. Of this small number, however, I
shall mention here only one—Reil. While he spent the
greater part of his life in Germany, he was in reality a
native of Holland.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Johann Christian Reil</span> was born at Rhaude, East Friesland,
in 1759. His father, who was the pastor of the village
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>church, gave his son an excellent preliminary training,
which enabled him, at the age of ten, to enter the high school
(<i>Gymnasium</i>) in the neighboring town of Norden. On
attaining his twentieth year, Johann entered the University
of Goettingen, but he remained there only a short time,
as he had become convinced that the Halle University
offered greater facilities for those who intended, as did Reil,
to follow a medical career. Three years later, armed with
the degree of Doctor of Medicine, he began the practice of
his profession at Norden. In the course of five years he
managed to build up such a reputation as a successful practitioner
that the University of Halle invited him to occupy
the position of Professor Extraordinary of Clinical Medicine.
Then, after the lapse of only a short year from the
time of his acceptance of this invitation, he was promoted
to the full professorship. Almost simultaneously he was
appointed (1789) to the position of City Physician of Halle.
It was probably while serving in the latter capacity that he
began to reveal to the Government that he was not only an
excellent physician but also possessed, at the same time,
unusual executive ability.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the years 1789 and 1806, at which latter date the
German army met with a disastrous defeat at the hands of
the French (battle of Jena), the almost constant warfare
brought all official university work to a stop. But Reil was
not idle during this long period, for it was at this time that
he devoted himself chiefly to laboratory research work with
reference to the anatomy and physiology of the brain and
nerves. The products of this work are recorded in the
Archives of Physiology which Reil published in 1796 in
association with Autenrieth, and they are pronounced by
Sudhoff to be masterly. One of the cerebral structures
which Reil was the first to describe is that known to all
anatomists as “the island of Reil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another important series of studies which were made by
Reil were published by him under the title: “On the Diagnosis
and Treatment of Fevers” (Halle and Berlin, 1799–1816;
3d edition, 1820–1828).</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, mention should be made of a memoir on “Vital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Force” which Reil published in the first volume of his
Archives, in July, 1795; an essay which—according to Sudhoff—should
be read with very close attention, for it, more
than all his other published writings, has carried Reil’s
name (and will continue so to carry it in the future) triumphantly
through the history of the science of biology.
The author states his final conclusion as to the nature of
vital force in the following words: “Every part of an organism
accomplishes its work through its own inherent power,
and the latter is a characteristic phenomenon that is dependent
upon the manner in which the material of which it is
composed is mixed and also upon the form that it takes.”
Dezeimeris gives a slightly different rendering of this passage,
viz., “It is absurd to search for the source of life
(vital force) elsewhere than in the tissues themselves, and
in them the vital phenomena vary partly according to the
manner in which their elements are mixed and partly
according to the form in which they are arranged.” Farther
on in this volume, as I shall show, Claude Bernard, the
distinguished French biologist, furnishes a third definition
of “vital force.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the terrible fighting that occurred at the battle of
Leipzig in 1813 necessitated the rapid construction and
organization of hospitals large enough to accommodate the
many thousands of sick and wounded<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> that had accumulated
after this battle, the King of Prussia promptly assigned to
Reil the entire management of this important business; and
the result proved that he had entrusted this work to the
right man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reil’s death from typhus fever occurred at Halle on
November 12, 1813.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sudhoff thus sums up the most striking traits of this distinguished
physician’s character: “He was never satisfied
with half-way measures, and bold schemes and great undertakings
occupied his thoughts at all times. At the bedside
he gave himself up unreservedly to the interests of the
patient.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><span class='sc'>Samuel Hahnemann</span> was born at Meissen, Saxony, in
1755. Although his parents were poor he managed to obtain
a good education, not only in the fundamentals usually
taught at the schools, but also in the knowledge of the various
languages, such as Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Spanish,
English, French and Italian. In his medical training he
advanced so rapidly that already at the comparatively early
age of thirty-five he was recognized as one of the leading
physicians of Germany. Even Hufeland, who at this period
(about 1790) was the highest medical authority in the
nation, accorded him full confidence both as a man and as a
chemist; and yet at the same time there is no evidence to
show that he frankly adopted his teachings with regard to
the new doctrine of homoeopathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hahnemann’s first experiments in relation to the action
of drugs—says Wheeler, the most recent translator of the
“Organon”—were made upon cinchona bark, which at that
period was universally admitted to possess remarkable
power in relieving and curing “ague,” as the usual form of
malarial disease was then termed. “Hahnemann’s experiment”—he
goes on to say—“consisted in taking a large
dose of cinchona bark while he was in good health and noting
its effects upon his healthy body. To his surprise he
found reproduced upon himself all the chief phenomena
(and even many of the minor symptoms) of a paroxysm of
ague. When the attack passed off, a second dose produced
a second paroxysm, and Hahnemann was presently face to
face with the fact that this drug, which so often cured ague,
was capable of reproducing in his own healthy body the
phenomena of ague. Like, in fact, cured like.... As soon
as the cinchona experiment suggested to Hahnemann the
possibility that the principle of like to like (<i>similia similibus</i>)
might prove a general law of healing, he began a systematic
study of the records of medicine in the search for
instances.... Over and over again he found that a drug
prescribed empirically had proved itself capable of curing
conditions similar to those which it could produce. The
records of medicine, in fact, gave plenty of encouragement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to his now dawning belief that <i>similia similibus</i> is a genuine
Law of Cure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is at this point, as it seems to me, that Hahnemann displays
the first and most important defect in his reasoning
machinery. He allowed what seemed to him to be a most
important and highly beneficent therapeutic truth immediately
to take possession of his whole being,—indeed, to
take such complete possession that, from this moment forward,
throughout the remainder of his life, he was utterly
unable to weigh with a calm and unprejudiced mind the
various facts and considerations which ultimately relegated
homoeopathy to its proper place in the medico-historical
museum, alongside those hoary relics of methodism, incantations,
the weaving of charms, Stahlism, Brunonianism,
etc. In short, he lacked those immensely important mental
characteristics which enabled Harvey to discover the more
important facts relating to the circulation of the blood, and
which made it possible for Jenner to place in the hands of
his fellow men an effective weapon of defense against the
deadly ravages of small-pox. If asked to say what are these
characteristics, I would reply: A state of mind so open and
so unprejudiced that it can weigh with absolute fairness all
the evidence laid before it, and an imagination so clever
and so fertile in resources that it is able to invent the means
of reproducing at will all those phenomena which it is desirable
to study more closely. These, I believe, are the
characteristics which Hahnemann lacked and which are
absolutely necessary for the creation of a permanently useful
creed and principles of therapeutics.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Hahnemann’s “Organon,” he provides quite a long
series of aphorisms in which the new doctrine is somewhat
fully developed. I have transcribed, below, a few of these
in order that my readers may be able to learn at first hand
just what their author had in mind when he wrote them.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Aphorism 5.</span>—It may be granted that every disease must depend
upon an alteration in the inner working of the human organism.
This disease can only be mentally conceived through its outward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>signs and all that these signs reveal; in no way whatever can the
disease itself be recognized.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Aphorism 6.</span>—... A thing or a condition demands a first proximate
cause only in order to come into existence; where the thing
or condition actually exists it requires no further originating, no
first and proximate cause, for its continued existence. Thus a
disease, once established, endures independently of its proximate,
exciting, primal cause: endures without further need of its cause:
endures even if its cause no longer exists. How, then, can the
removal of the cause be held to be the principal condition of the
cure of the disease?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Aphorism 8.</span>—The unprejudiced observer ... is unable, however
acute he may be, to take note of anything, in any single case of
disease, except the changes in the condition of the body and soul
which are perceptible by the senses, the so-called disease phenomena,
symptoms in fact; in other words, he can note only such fallings
away from a former state of health as are recognizable by the
patient himself, the friends in attendance, and the physician. All
these perceptible signs make up together the picture of the disease.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Aphorism 9.</span>—... And thus this symptom-complex ... is the
only means whereby it is possible to discover a remedy for it (the
disease), the only means which can indicate the most appropriate
agent of cure.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Aphorism 13.</span>—Now since, when cure is effected through the
removal of the whole range of the perceptible signs and symptoms,
the inward change which caused the symptoms is also removed
(that is, the totality of the disease), it follows that the physician
has only to clear away the entire symptom-complex in order also to
get rid of the inward alteration—in other words, to remove the
whole disease, the disease itself, a feat which must always be the
only aim of the rational healer; for the essence of the art of
medicine consists in compassing the restoration of health, not in
searching for the change in the inward and hidden things; a quest
which can tend to nothing but fruitless speculation.</p>

<p class='c019'>And then follows, in the form of an “Author’s Note,” the
subjoined commentary by Hahnemann:—</p>

<p class='c017'>It is only through a misuse of the desire to reach the eternal,
sown in the spirit of man for nobler purposes, that these impudent
attempts have been made upon the realm of the impossible, those
speculative broodings over the essential nature of the medicinal
powers of drugs, over vitality, over the invisible working of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>organism in health and over the changes of this hidden inner working
which constitute disease—in other words, over the inner nature
and essence of illness.... When the physician maintains that
research into such things is necessary, then he shows a misconception
of the capacities of men and a misunderstanding of the
requisites for the work of healing.</p>

<p class='c018'>... If only it had served the practice of medicine in the slightest
degree,—if all this subtile investigation had revealed the true
remedy for the least of diseases, it might yet pass for desirable!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Aphorism 31.</span>—The great homeopathic law of cure rests on this
law of man’s nature, revealed by experience, that diseases are only
destroyed and cured by similar diseases. The homeopathic law may
be thus formulated: that a disease can only be destroyed and cured
by a remedy which has the tendency to produce a similar disease,
for the effects of drugs are in themselves no other than artificial
diseases.</p>

<p class='c019'>The preceding more or less disconnected portions of the
text of Hahnemann’s great work—“Organon of the Rational
Art of Healing”—are quoted here, not with the idea
that they will convey to the reader a very clear idea of the
doctrine of homoeopathy and of the way in which it is to be
applied in the practice of medicine, but rather for the purpose
of showing the extraordinary manner in which Hahnemann
utilized his reasoning powers in his efforts to create
a new pathology and a new system of therapeutics that
would harmonize with this new doctrine.</p>

<p class='c007'>A further inquiry into the manner in which the disciples
of Hahnemann acted upon these principles of homoeopathy
in the practice of their profession establishes the fact that
they believed in the remedial efficiency of doses that contained
as small a quantity as the billionth or the decillionth
of a grain of the drug. In a report which he makes to the
Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh, James J. Simpson,
the distinguished professor of midwifery in the University
of that city, comments (1851–1852) upon these infinitely
small doses in the following terms:—</p>

<p class='c017'>If a grown-up man were gravely and seriously to assert to the
world that two and two make five, the world would be inclined to
look upon him as doubtfully rational, inasmuch as he defied the
principles of common sense. And when other grown-up men tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the world that they can cure this or that disease with a billionth
or decillionth of a grain of this or that common and probably inert
drug, they express an opinion perhaps even more intensely and
directly absurd than the doctrine of two and two making five; but
they do not equally see through the absurdity and impossibility
of the more complicated, but equally ridiculous idea, of the billionth
or decillionth of a grain of oyster-shell, or chamomile, or belladonna,
or the like, having any possible effect whatever upon the economy,
for, resting contented with the mere name, they never once think
or dream of what in reality a billionth or a decillionth amounts
to.... For it is a sum the mere figures of which can scarcely give
us any conception of its infinitesimal amount, viz., 1 followed by
sixty ciphers.... Surely men holding such fantastical doctrines,
are not men mentally fit to be members of such a Society as this.</p>

<p class='c019'>In further corroboration of Dr. Simpson’s remarks, I
may be permitted to furnish here a few brief extracts from
Jahr’s “Manual of Homoeopathic Medicine” (Vol. I., pp.
386 et seq.):—</p>

<p class='c017'>Symptoms produced by common House-Salt.—Rigidity of all the
joints, which crack when they are moved,... Bad effects of a
disappointment.... Frightful dreams of quarrels, murders, fire,
thieves, etc.... Typhus fever with debility.... Awkwardness....
Numbness and insensibility of one side of the nose....
Speech embarrassed in consequence of the heaviness of the tongue....
Loss of appetite, especially for bread, and repugnance to
tobacco smoke.... Numerous flaws in the nails.... Redness of
the great toe, etc. (The list contains at least thirty additional
symptoms.)</p>

<p class='c019'>At the present day it is hard to believe that as recently
as during the first half of the nineteenth century there
existed an editor who was willing to publish such childish
reading matter as the above. And yet one is obliged at the
same time to admit that the appearance of text like this in
a reputable book furnishes good evidences that there was no
lack of readers to whom the information imparted proved
acceptable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the years 1850 and 1860, homoeopathy assumed a
good deal of prominence in the city of New York. Many of
the leading families during this period turned their backs
on the regular practitioners,—the “Allopaths,” as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>were then frequently called,—and confided themselves and
their maladies to the care of members of the new school.
This naturally led to much bitterness of feeling between the
two groups of physicians, just as had happened at an earlier
date in the larger towns of England and Scotland; and this
condition of things lasted for at least twenty years. Hostile
action on the part of the county and state medical societies
proved of very little use in diminishing the popularity of
the new method of treating diseases; and so it was finally
decided to withdraw all further opposition to the new sect
and to see what an attitude of indifference and the stopping
of all persecution would accomplish. Thanks largely to this
wise and sensible policy, homoeopathy gradually lost its
short-lived ascendancy, and the more sensible members of
the community returned to their former allegiance. What
I have said in regard to the rise and fall of homoeopathy in
New York is, I am confident, true in a general way of its
fate in most of the other large cities of the United States,
but I am personally familiar only with the conditions that
prevailed in my native city.</p>

<p class='c007'>I wish that I might speak with a larger measure of authority
in regard to the causes that led to the favorable reception
of this new sect in New York, but I am not able to do
this, and I doubt whether anybody among my contemporaries
is able to do much better than merely to suggest some of
the more obvious causes which favored the popularity of
the new school of practice. Among such causes I may mention
the fact that in those days the practitioners of the regular
school were in the habit of prescribing drugs in large
doses and with very little effort to render them palatable.
Take, for example, senna tea, of which bad-tasting medicine
the patient was expected to take a large teacupful shortly
after the early crowing of the cock; and if, a day or two
later, a repetition of the same dose was ordered by the
attending physician, can anybody wonder if the remedy was
quickly pronounced by the patient much worse than the
disease? Experiences like the one just narrated were by
no means uncommon, and, as a consequence, many families
did not hesitate to transfer their patronage to a class of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>physicians who never prescribed any remedy that had a bad
smell or taste or that caused the slightest bodily discomfort.
Then, beside, it is a well-known fact that, during the
period now under consideration, the regular practitioners
had, in not a few instances, been guilty of prescribing therapeutic
measures which actually inflicted harm. Such, for
example, were the giving of mercurial preparations in too
large doses, the too frequent resort to bloodletting, etc.
For all these reasons, it is not at all strange that for a
period of several years (1850–1875) homoeopathy flourished
in New York. In all fairness, therefore, it may be said that
the great improvement in the manner of administering
drugs which took place, both here and in European countries,
during the period from 1860 to 1880, may be attributed
indirectly to the influence of the new sect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hahnemann died in Paris in 1843, at the age of eighty-eight.</p>

<p>HUFELAND<br /><br />(From Eugen Hollaender’s “<i>Medizin und Plastik</i>,” by permission.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland</span>, who was born in 1762, at
Langensalza, in the district of Thuringia, Central Germany,
founded, about the year 1795, a medical journal that bore the
title, “<i>Hufeland’s Journal der Practischen Heilkunde</i>,”—the
first German medical journal that was devoted largely
to matters of interest to the practitioner. It was published
regularly every month and was in almost every respect similar
to the best medical journals of the present day. It was
kept in active circulation up to the time of the founder’s
death in 1836, and was highly appreciated by physicians
generally. Hufeland’s reputation, however, rested less
upon this journal, notwithstanding its great popularity,
than it did upon his famous treatise entitled “The Art of
Prolonging Life” (<i>Makrobiotik</i>). This book, which has
been translated into every modern language, and which
during the past century and a half has never had a rival in
the field of which it treats, continues to-day to furnish entertaining
reading to hundreds of men and women, laymen as
well as physicians, who desire to learn the well-established
facts regarding human longevity. Farther on, I will furnish
a few extracts from both of these publications, thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>enabling those of my readers who have not yet had an opportunity
to become acquainted with Hufeland’s writings or
with his work as a journalist, to learn something more definite
about the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as I am able to ascertain, Hufeland’s only other
important activities were those connected with the positions
which he held in the Universities of Jena (1793–1798) and
Berlin (1798–1835). In the former institution, he held the
Chair of Medicine; in the latter he held the same chair, but
he was also acknowledged to be the guiding spirit in all
matters relating to the organization and management of
that important centre of medical education.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the items of special interest in Hufeland’s “<i>Makrobiotik</i>,”
I find the following:—</p>

<p class='c017'>On the 2nd of August, 1790, a carabinier named Petit jumped
into the Rhine from one of the windows of the Military Hospital
at Strassburg. Half an hour later,—as nearly as could be learned
from an inquiry that was made at the time of the occurrence,—his
body was taken from the water and carried into the hospital.
To all appearances the man was dead; no evidences of life were discovered.
Nevertheless, efforts were made to revive him. The body
was placed in a thoroughly warmed bed, with the head lying high
up on a pillow, the arms resting on the trunk, and the legs extended
side by side. The only other measures adopted were the following:
At short but regular intervals of time heated cloths were placed
over the region of the stomach and over the legs; and heated stones
wrapped in cloths were placed in different parts of the bed. At
the end of seven or eight minutes a slight twitching of the man’s
upper eyelids was observed, and a short time afterward his lower
jaw, which up to that moment had been in firm contact with the
upper jaw, became separated from it and permitted a little frothy
mucus to escape between the lips. After this discovery had been
made, a little wine was cautiously introduced into the man’s mouth.
Apparently it was swallowed, and then other small doses of wine
were administered, all of them apparently being swallowed. Under
this stimulation the pulse beats at the wrist became perceptible,
and at the end of one hour the man was able to answer questions.</p>

<p class='c019'>In his comments upon this interesting case of restoration
of life after apparent death from drowning, Hufeland makes
the following remarks:—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>It is evident, therefore, that artificial heat acts with the same
vigor immediately after the appearance of what seems to be death
as it does at the very first dawn of life; it gradually fans into a
living flame the few vital sparks which may still be present in the
body.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the preceding account of the means adopted for resuscitating
the soldier who was believed to be dead from the
effects of drowning, no mention is made of friction of the
surface of the body as a procedure of some value. Hufeland,
very properly, lays great stress upon the need of
applying heat. Friction, however, if employed intelligently,
may prove a most efficient adjunct; and, when I use the
expression “intelligently,” I mean that friction may be
utilized as a powerful agent for propelling toward the heart
the artificially heated blood contained in the cutaneous
blood-vessels, thus contributing in no small degree toward
the reëstablishment of the circulation. The kind of friction
required—it seems scarcely necessary to say—should
always be directed from the extremities toward the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>In another part of the same work Hufeland gives an
account of several instances of exceptional longevity. One
of these relates to Terentia, the wife of Cicero, who, despite
the sore trials to which she was subjected, and despite the
occasional attacks of gout with which she was afflicted,
attained the great age of 103. A second instance is that of
Livia, the wife of the Emperor Augustus, a woman who
possessed a domineering and passionate character, but who,
nevertheless, was blessed with a full share of happiness.
At the time of her death she was ninety years old. Two
other Roman women are mentioned by Hufeland as having
attained a great age. They were both of them distinguished
actresses. The first one, whose name was Luceia, began her
theatrical career at a very early age and was 112 years old
on the occasion of her last appearance on the stage; her
entire theatrical career having covered a period of one
hundred years. Galeria Copiala is the name of the other
actress, who was at the same time famous as a <i>danseuse</i>.
Ninety years after her first appearance on the stage she took
part in a complimentary performance in honor of Pompey;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and even at a still later date she acted in a play which was
intended to celebrate the distinguished reign of the Emperor
Augustus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hufeland mentions further instances of great longevity
which he had gleaned from Jewish history, and from these
I select the following: Abraham lived to be 175 years old,
and his wife, Sarah, the only woman of that remote period
of time of whom we possess a precise knowledge, died at the
age of 127; Isaac attained the age of 180; Jacob lived to be
147; Ishmael, a son of Hagar (one of Abraham’s hand-maids)
and a man of warlike habits, attained the age of
137; and Joseph, the next to the youngest of Jacob’s sons,
a political leader and a man of great wisdom, died at the age
of 110. Moses, a man of conspicuous intellectual capacity
and possessing a strong will, lived to be 120 years old. But
even he complained that “the life of a man usually lasts
only seventy years, or, in exceptional instances, eighty
years”—a statement, says Hufeland, which justifies the
belief that 3000 years ago the duration of human life was
about the same as it is to-day. Joshua, who led a very active
life and was a good deal of a warrior, died at the age of 110;
Eli, the High Priest, a man of a phlegmatic temperament,
lived to be a little over ninety years of age; and Elisha, who
despised all the conventionalities of life and cared nothing
for wealth, lived far beyond the limit of 100 years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who recommended
care in the choice of one’s food, moderation in eating, and
the cultivation of gymnastic exercises, attained a good old
age. He claimed that after a man reached his eightieth
year, no matter how great an age he might afterward attain,
he should be reckoned among those who have ceased to live.</p>

<p class='c007'>The measures which Hufeland enumerates as being specially
conducive to longevity are those with which my readers—it
may safely be assumed—are already familiar. The
list comprises both those things which a man or a woman
should carefully avoid, and those which often prove helpful
in prolonging the period of one’s life, and which may be
summed up in that old device: “Moderation in all things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On turning over the pages of the volume of Hufeland’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Journal in which are contained the issues of the first half
of the year 1833, I came across the report of a very unusual
case that was observed by a Dr. Heymann in the village of
Oldendorf. His report reads as follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'>A very poor working-woman, who in addition to her poverty was
obliged to live in a house that was overrun with mice, retired to her
bed one night in company with her child who was about three years
old. One of the last things she did, after going to bed, was to hand
to the latter a crust of bread, in the hope that the little one might
thus, by quieting its hunger, fall asleep more readily. Having done
this the mother herself soon fell asleep. But shortly afterward she
was awakened by the terrified cries of the child, who insisted that
there was a mouse in its throat. Having quickly obtained a light
the mother discovered that not only was the child retching violently,
but that it was bringing up visible quantities of blood from the
stomach. In the contortions caused by the pain the child indicated
the pit of the stomach as the source of all its agony. The severe
pain persisted for about two hours and then suddenly ceased, but
the retching and bringing up of blood continued at intervals for
some time longer. On the following morning the child was given
plenty of sweetened milk to drink. At the end of forty-eight hours
the remains of the mouse were found in the stool. The creature’s
body presented a collapsed appearance and the skin lacked its
covering of fur in several places.</p>

<p class='c018'>For quite a long time subsequently the child remained in an ailing
condition, with symptoms of disordered digestion. Its death, however,
which occurred at a somewhat later period, was apparently
dependent upon an entirely different disease,—one that had no
connection whatever with the incident just described.</p>

<p class='c019'>After reviewing all the evidence in this extraordinary
case, Hufeland sees no reason for doubting the correctness
of the preceding report in all its essential features. As to
the manner in which a mouse may find its way into the
human stomach, the following statement is permissible. To
begin with, it is a matter of common knowledge that mice
often run about an occupied bedroom at night in search of
food, and that their sense of smell is extraordinarily acute.
Furthermore, it is easy to understand how a mouse, after
tracing the odor of food to the partially open mouth of a
sleeping child, would not hesitate, if pressed by hunger, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>enter that cavity for the purpose of securing possession of
the particles of food lodged therein; and it is also easy to
understand how the intruder might then be caught as in a
trap by the closing of the mouth which spontaneously followed.
Under such circumstances the creature’s choice of
the oesophageal route into the stomach as a way of escape
was most natural, and equally so were the efforts made by
the beast—as shown by the pain at the pit of the stomach
and by the retching of a bloody fluid—to gnaw its way
through the gastric mucous membrane.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although Hufeland yielded to the prevailing tendency
among German physicians of the eighteenth century to
adopt doctrines, both in pathology and in therapeutics,
which are based upon hypotheses rather than upon facts
established by experimentation, or by direct observation at
the bedside or at the autopsy, and which as a consequence
played a very small part in the genuine advance of the
science of medicine, he nevertheless, as I have tried to show
in the preceding pages, should be classed as a most useful
and honorable member of our profession.</p>

<p class='c007'>Remember—he is reported to have said to his younger confrères—that
there are two maxims which you should keep in mind, viz.:—</p>

<p class='c020'>1. <i>Natura sanat, medicus curat morbos</i>;<br />
(Nature cures disease, the physician merely does what he
can to facilitate the operations of nature);</p>
<p class='c021'>and</p>

<p class='c020'>2. <i>Ne noceas, si prodesse credis.</i><br />
(In your efforts to afford relief be careful not to do permanent
harm.)</p>

<p>ALBRECHT VON HALLER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Albrecht von Haller</span>, whose many contributions to the
science of medicine have assured him a permanent and
very high position in the temple of fame, was born October
16, 1708, of parents who belonged to two of the old patrician
families of Berne, Switzerland. In childhood he suffered
from rachitic symptoms and was constantly ailing; but,
despite these drawbacks, he manifested at a very early age
evidences of possessing to an unusual degree certain intellectual
gifts and of having a genuine love for work. Thus,
for example, he began—shortly after he had learned to
write—recording in alphabetical order all the words that he
had been taught and the meaning of which had been explained
to him. At the age of ten he prepared for his own
use a vocabulary composed of Chaldean, Hebrew and Greek
words, and two years later he compiled, from the dictionaries
of Moreri and Bayle, a collection of concise biographies
of the men who had achieved celebrity in the more
important branches of science, and he surprised his teachers
by his ability to compose verses in Latin as well as in his
native language, German. Before he reached his fifteenth
year he had attained considerable distinction, both as an
anatomist and as a poet, a combination of gifts extraordinarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>rare. He received his early training in anatomy and
general medicine at the University of Tübingen, under the
guidance of the two Duverneys, father and son, and of Elias
Camerarius, all three of whom were professors of considerable
celebrity in their respective departments. Jean
Guichard Duverney (1691–1759), for example, was the first
anatomist to furnish a complete and very thorough description
of the solar plexus.</p>

<p class='c007'>An incident which occurred during his student days at
Tübingen reveals so strikingly von Haller’s strength of
purpose and his unwillingness to permit anything to divert
him from the path which he had decided to follow, that I
shall not hesitate to relate it briefly here. In company with
a few of his fellow students he participated in one of those
beer-drinking bouts which are of such frequent occurrence
in German university towns, and was in due course of time
made acquainted with the legitimate effects that follow such
excessive indulgence—effects that are felt as “seediness”
and a sense of physical misery (symptoms to which the
Germans have given the striking but untranslatable name
of <i>Katzenjammer</i>). This single experience sufficed to impress
upon von Haller’s mind the folly of such indulgence
and he never afterward permitted himself to take part in
an excess of this nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although von Haller, upon the death of his father, had
been left with very slender financial means, he managed,
under the guidance of Albinus, on leaving Tübingen in 1725,
to visit Leyden, in Holland, where he was able to prosecute
his anatomical researches and at the same time to follow
the instruction of Boerhaave, who was still at that period
in full possession of his powers as a teacher. Extraordinary
as it will appear to the physicians of to-day, von
Haller, when only nineteen years old, passed successfully
the required examinations at Leyden and was given the
degree of Doctor of Medicine (1727).</p>

<p class='c007'>From Holland von Haller went first to London, where he
accepted the invitation of James Douglas, the anatomist,
to assist him in his studies of the structure of the bones.
Then from there he next visited Paris (1728), where he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>for his teachers Le Dran, the distinguished French surgeon,
and Winslow, the well-known anatomist. It was his original
intention to make a prolonged stay in the French metropolis,
but, unfortunately, his ambition to get ahead as fast as
possible in the study of anatomy led him to disregard certain
precautions which, in the early part of the eighteenth century,
it was not at all safe for men interested in this branch
of medical science to neglect. Recognizing the fact that,
in order to advance his knowledge of anatomy, he must
have a certain amount of human dissecting material at his
command, and finding that he could procure this material
in no other way than by the process commonly known as
“body-snatching,” he decided, in association with one of
the prosectors of the medical school, to adopt that method of
procuring the material needed. The plan was successfully
carried out, the disinterred body was transferred to von
Haller’s apartment, and the two enthusiastic anatomists
had already done a certain amount of dissecting when an
unexpected obstacle was encountered. The layman who
occupied the adjoining room overheard enough of the conversation
that was being carried on between von Haller and
his friend to suspect strongly the true nature of the work
in which they were engaged. But, to make sure that his
surmise was correct, he bored a peek-hole through the partition
wall, and thus was able to remove from his mind all
doubt about the nature of this work. The police were
promptly notified, and von Haller was summoned to appear
before the authorities to answer the charge of having disobeyed
the law relating to dissections of the human body.
Not being able to furnish a satisfactory reply to this charge,
and wishing to escape from the severe penalties that would
certainly have been inflicted upon him had he been apprehended,
von Haller went at once into hiding in Paris and
eventually succeeded in making his way over the border into
Switzerland.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1729 he began the practice of medicine in his native
city, after having taught anatomy for a short time in Basel;
but he took only a subordinate interest in the treatment of
disease, his preference being strongly for the scientific and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>literary parts of medicine. In 1734 or soon afterward he
published a collection of his own odes and letters in German
verses. These reveal very fully the nobility of his character,
his good sense and the high standard of his philosophy.
Dezeimeris says that von Haller offers the very first example
of a man who has been able to develop to an equal degree his
talents of poet and of anatomist.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1735 he was appointed Chief Custodian of the Public
Library at Berne, and while he held this office he prepared
a <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of all the books contained in that collection.
At the same time he wrote a classified, chronologically
arranged list of the 5000 or more coins and medals
which are preserved in the library.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1736 the Hanover Regency offered him the professorship
of anatomy, botany and surgery in the University of
Goettingen, and agreed at the same time to furnish all the
money needed for carrying out the extensive plans which
he had formed for improving the facilities for teaching
these branches of medical science. Von Haller unhesitatingly
accepted the invitation, and during the following
seventeen years (1736–1753) devoted his time and his best
efforts to the fulfilment of the duties which his triple chair
involved. Not only did anatomy, botany and surgery
greatly thrive during this long period of time, but the university
through his intelligent efforts gained in many other
directions. It was upon his advice, for example, that the
beautiful anatomical theatre at Goettingen was built and
equipped. The botanical garden was another of the creations
at Goettingen which owed its existence to von Haller.
If I were to furnish a list of the improvements which, one
after the other, were carried out in the university at his
suggestion I would certainly be obliged to mention among
other things the following: an establishment in which pupils
might receive proper training in anatomical and botanical
drawing; the creation of a cabinet of anatomical specimens
and of a college of surgery; and finally the founding of a
school for midwives. In short, it was largely due to von
Haller’s enlightened conception of what such an institution
of learning requires and to his untiring efforts that the University
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of Goettingen became, toward the end of the eighteenth
century and during the first half of the nineteenth, one
of the leading universities of Europe. Indeed he might
justly be called its founder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Von Haller’s health suffered under this long strain, and he
was therefore more than justified in asking the Regency of
Hanover for permission to resign and take up his residence
in Switzerland. His request was unhesitatingly granted;
and, after resting for a few months from his recent labors,
von Haller resumed those quiet literary undertakings which
he loved so keenly and which enabled him to publish such
famous works as the following:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Primae Lineae Physiologiae</span>” (First Lines of Physiology),
Goettingen, 1747 (also 1751)—the very first systematic treatise on
physiology of which we have any knowledge. A German edition
was not published until 1759–1776.</p>

<p class='c018'>Commentaries on Boerhaave’s “<span class='sc'>Institutiones Medicinae</span>,”
1739–1744.</p>

<p class='c018'>“<span class='sc'>Elementa Physiologiae Corporis Humani</span>,” 8 vols., Lausanne,
1757–1766; the most important of all his works.</p>

<p class='c018'>“<span class='sc'>Bibliotheca Anatomica</span>,” 2 vols., 1774–1777.</p>

<p class='c018'>“<span class='sc'>Bibliotheca Chirurgica</span>,” 2 vols., 1774–1775.</p>

<p class='c018'>“<span class='sc'>Bibliotheca Medicinae Practicae</span>,” 4 vols., 1776–1788.</p>

<p class='c018'>“<span class='sc'>Expériences sur les Parties Sensibles et Irritables</span>,” 4
parts, Lausanne, 1759.</p>

<p class='c019'>These titles represent only a small part of the numerous
books and elaborate essays published by this tireless
worker. In 1749 he was ennobled by the Emperor, thus
gaining the right, so highly esteemed in Germany, of placing
a “von” before his name.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the middle of the eighteenth century there appears to
have existed considerable confusion in the minds of scientific
men regarding the distinction between the terms
“sensibility” and “irritability,” and to von Haller is due
the credit of having once and for all defined the correct
meaning of these words. As early as in 1747, when he published
the first edition of his treatise on physiology, von
Haller taught that the contractile force of muscles is supplied
by the nerves, and that in this way they acquire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span><i>irritability</i>, a force which they cannot exercise except
through the influence of the nerves. Irritability, therefore,
is not a characteristic that originates in muscular tissue but
is conferred upon it by the nerves. Von Haller’s experiments
reveal the fact that the heart possesses the maximum
degree of irritability. Next in order come the intestines and
the diaphragm, the ordinary red muscles possessing a lesser
degree of irritability.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order that the reader may form at least some idea of
von Haller’s manner of treating physiological topics I give
below a rough translation<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> of the first three paragraphs
which occur in Chapter XX of his <i>Primae Lineae Physiologiae</i>
(edition of 1751):—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Sleep</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>564.—The power which a person in perfect health possesses freely
to exercise the different senses and to perform voluntary movements
is called <i>wakefulness</i> or the state of being awake; the absence of the
power to make voluntary movements and to utilize the different
senses, combined with the quietude of all of them, bears the name
of <i>sleep</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>565.—In sleep the mind either stops thinking entirely of the
things which have been stored up by the individual in his memory
or which are well-known facts, or else it busies itself exclusively
with certain ideas or with impressions that produce upon the mind,
at the time, pictures almost as vivid as the actual things or occurrences
which they represent would produce. The term “insomnia”
is employed when it is desired to designate the latter condition of
the mind, and the mental pictures thus presented produce the effect
that—although voluntary motions are at the time all in abeyance,
and although the mind is absolutely quiet in all other respects—there
remain certain directions in which it continues to operate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>actively, thus producing an elevation of the spirits (<i>i.e.</i>, a certain
degree of excitement) and more or less wakefulness. Sometimes a
certain number of voluntary movements are associated with these
mental impressions, and this may occur in such a degree that the
organs of speech and many of the joints—indeed at times all of
them—are compelled to act in harmony with the mental impressions.
When this degree of insomnia is reached the person so
affected is called a “somnambulist.”</p>

<p class='c018'>566.—But in sleep the distribution of the humors of the body
goes on without let or hindrance; and, similarly, the circulation of
the blood, the peristaltic action of the stomach, intestines and
sphincters, and the respiratory movements continue their activity.
This complex state of affairs—viz., the coexistence of quietude of
certain parts of the body with continued motion in other parts—has
made it difficult to ascertain the mechanical cause of sleep.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>In his investigations into these subjects, von Haller
placed his reliance mainly on vivisections and on experiments
made upon animals. “A single experiment of this
nature,” he said, “is often sufficient to disprove the deceptive
conclusions or views that have prevailed through a
period of years.” It is to John Hunter of England, however,
says Puschmann, that the greatest credit is due for
the introduction of the experimental method as a means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>ascertaining the truth in questions of pathology; and von
Haller was unquestionably one of the first German physicians
to adopt the method.</p>

<p class='c007'>Von Haller died at Berne on December 12, 1777.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Johann Georg Zimmermann</span> was born in 1728 at Brugg in
the Canton de Berne, Switzerland. Left an orphan at the
age of eighteen, and obliged without aid from outside to
choose the career which he would follow, he decided to study
medicine; and with this object in view he went to Goettingen,
Germany, where he was received into the family of
Albrecht von Haller, who was at that time a professor in
the university. Five years later (1751), when he took his
doctor’s degree, he chose for the subject of his thesis, at von
Haller’s suggestion, the doctrine of irritability. Upon his
return to Berne in 1752, he began the practice of medicine
and shortly afterward accepted the position of official physician
for his native town of Brugg. It was during this period
of his life that he wrote those treatises which made his name
famous throughout Germany, viz., “On Solitude,” Zuerich,
1756; “On Experience in the Practice of Medicine,” Zuerich,
1763 and 1767; “On National Pride,” Zuerich, 1768
(5th edition); and “On the Epidemic of Dysentery which
prevailed during the year 1765,” Zuerich, 1767 (later edition
in 1789).</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1768, through the influence of Dr. Tissot, of Lausanne,
he was given the appointment of Physician to the King of
England at the Court of Hanover. During the last years
of his life he took a great interest in political events, recognizing
with remarkable foresight the approach of an
immense revolution. So strong was his belief that current
events pointed to the approach of such a catastrophe, and
so depressing were the effects of this belief upon his naturally
hypochondriac type of mind, that the last years of his
life were thereby rendered most painful. He died on October
7, 1795, not long after the full effects of the Reign of
Terror had developed in France.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tissot, who had known Zimmermann well for more than
forty years, has written a most interesting notice of his life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and has placed a just estimate upon the value of his writings.
(Dezeimeris.) Sprengel, the author of a well-known
and highly esteemed history of medicine, speaks in the following
terms of Zimmermann’s treatise “On Experience
in the Practice of Medicine”:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The manly and brilliant style in which it is written, its fascinating
eloquence, and the special talent which the author displays in
rendering marvelously clear—without at the same time robbing
them of any of their accuracy—the most obscure topics, make this
book of Zimmermann’s a veritable chef-d’oeuvre.... The importance
of genuine experience, its difference from false or blind
routine, the advantages which real erudition confers and the necessity
of combining it with experience, the nature of the obstacles
which an observing spirit must overcome, the absolute need of good
observations and the useful qualities which they should possess, the
effects of genius, and the manner in which conclusions are to be
drawn by analogy and by induction—these are the questions with
which the author of this classical treatise deals.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'>THE EARLIEST PUBLICATION IN EUROPE OF A
SYSTEMATIC TREATISE ON HYGIENE, PUBLIC
HEALTH AND MEDICO-LEGAL SCIENCE</p>
<p class='c005'>In the early part of the eighteenth century municipal and
private-house sanitation existed in comparatively few cities
of Europe, and then only in the wealthier quarters. Such
a thing as sanitary police was practically unknown, and
public health was considered only when the inhabitants were
threatened with a serious epidemic like that of cholera, the
plague, or leprosy. This indifference to public sanitation
persisted down to the end of the nineteenth century. On
arriving in Paris in the spring of 1857, at a time when the
city was overcrowded with travelers, my friend and I were
glad to secure a room on the fourth story of a modest hotel
situated in the central part of the city, quite near the Palais
Royal. We found no good reason to complain of the room
itself; it was clean and adequately well ventilated. But the
toilet facilities were such as one might expect to find in a
hotel of the fourteenth or fifteenth century. On the roof of
our building a lean-to had been constructed alongside a
broad brick chimney, and this shack, which was distant at
least forty feet from the doorway that led by a short stair-case
to the fourth story of the hotel, could be reached only
over a narrow plank walk that was wholly unprotected by a
railing. Then again, on a bicycling trip which I made in
1896, through the central part of France, my friend and I
experienced more than one surprise of a similar nature.
For example, in several of the smaller towns we found that
the ancient practice of throwing the slops out of the second-story
windows into the middle of the narrow street, still
persisted. But, in a matter of this kind, nothing is to be
gained by entering into many details; “enough is as good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>as a feast.” I merely wish to emphasize the fact that even
France, where civilization was so far advanced in many
respects, was fearfully slow in adopting the first principles
of house and municipal sanitation. It was only toward the
end of the nineteenth century that London, the birthplace
of the finest types of house and municipal sanitation, began
to give serious attention to this subject. During the early
part of the eighteenth century, however, even this great
metropolis was very backward in manifesting any marked
desire to improve the sanitary condition of its dwellings;
for, was it not the Earl of Chesterfield who, at this very
period of time (about 1750) made the statement, in a letter
to his natural son, that “the lanes or narrow passage-ways
in Holland are cleaner than the houses are in London?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in Germany, many of my readers will doubtless be
surprised to learn, that the first really serious attempt was
made to present to the world a scientific treatise on this subject,
a work which was published in several consecutive
volumes and which even to-day is consulted as a most trustworthy
and remarkably complete authority on municipal
and private-house sanitation. The work referred to was
written by J. P. Frank.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Johann Peter Frank</span>, more commonly spoken of as Peter
Frank, was born in 1745 at Rothalben, a village located in
territory which at that time belonged to the Grand Duchy
of Baden. He received a good preliminary training at the
High School of Pont-à-Mousson, and then afterward took
courses at the Universities of Heidelberg and Strassburg.
His medical degree was bestowed upon him in 1766 by the
first of these institutions, the subject of his thesis being
“Medical Police.” Two years later he commenced the practice
of his profession at the city of Baden-Baden, and in
1769 was appointed Court Physician at Rastatt.</p>

<p class='c007'>During these early years of his career he did not lose
interest in the subject which he had chosen for his thesis,
but continued to work upon it until, in 1768, he was ready
to submit to a bookseller the manuscript of Vol. I. The
latter, after receiving from a so-called medical expert an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>unfavorable report on the quality of the text, expressed his
unwillingness to publish the work. Frank’s discouragement
over this result was so great that he proceeded without
delay to throw the manuscript into the fire. Then, after
further reflection, he decided to begin work afresh on the
same theme, and thus it came about that he devoted the following
eleven years to the preparation of a new text for Vol.
I. In 1779 this first volume was published. In 1780, 1783,
1788 and 1813 four more volumes were issued. Volume VI
and two supplementary volumes were issued between the
years 1817 and 1819.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Notwithstanding its defects,” says Puschmann, “this
work is one of the most important, one of the greatest and
most creditable pieces of medical literature of which the
Germans may rightfully boast. Blumenbach called it a
classic, the first treatise of its kind and indeed possessing
a unique character.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the other works published by Peter Frank, works
which deal with pathology and the practice of medicine, the
most important is that entitled “<i>De Curandis Hominum
Morbis Epitome</i>” (“An abridged treatise on the diseases
to which man is liable”). As he progressed with the writing
of this treatise Frank undoubtedly discovered that he
could not, with any degree of satisfaction, accomplish his
original design of compressing what he had to say into an
“epitome”; and so, from this time forward, he carried on
the work, without paying any further attention to his
original plan of an abridgment, until the book had reached
its sixth volume; and even then it was not completed.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
Despite its incompleteness this work passed through several
editions, for it was highly appreciated for its practical
character and for the clearness of its descriptions of
disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1785 Frank accepted an invitation to take charge of the
clinical instruction at the University of Pavia, in the place
of Tissot who had resigned. Through Frank’s advice and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>persistent efforts the medical department of the Pavia University
was enriched by the addition of a chair of physiology
and comparative anatomy, an anatomical theatre capable
of seating 400 auditors, and a collection of pathologico-anatomical
preparations to which all the hospitals of that
part of Lombardy were obliged to contribute suitable specimens.
The establishment of a surgical clinic was another of
the improvements in the teaching facilities of the University
that should be credited to Peter Frank. The length of the
medical course was at his suggestion extended to five years.
Among his associates in the Faculty at this period were the
following distinguished men: Scarpa, in the chair of surgery,
Scopoli, in that of pharmacology, and Volta in
physics.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November, 1795, Frank returned to Vienna and was
almost immediately appointed Director of the Allgemeine
Krankenhaus and Professor of the Medical Clinic with a
salary of 5,000 florins and the privilege of occupying rent-free
a house that was located in the immediate neighborhood
of the hospital. At the same time the title of Aulic Councillor
(<i>Hofrath</i>) was conferred upon him. One of the first
improvements which he effected in the clinic was to have the
small wards for male and female patients materially
enlarged so that when twenty-five or thirty patients were
present, as was often the case, the air might not become
noticeably contaminated and thus rendered unfit for all who
were present to breathe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his teaching Frank never forgot, on all possible occasions,
to impress upon the students the importance of thinking
independently on the subjects that were brought before
them, as in this way they would learn to distinguish the
false from the true. Whenever he discovered that he had
made a mistake in one of his statements he did not hesitate
to confess the fact. His son, Joseph, is responsible for the
statement that his father never seemed to him happier than
when he had an opportunity of making to his auditors some
such speech as the following: “Gentlemen! Strike out this
or that line in one of the volumes of my work! When I
wrote it I believed that it was correct; but now I am convinced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>that the very opposite is the truth!” When Brunonianism
was first transplanted from Great Britain to the
Continent and was received enthusiastically by many physicians,
Frank was not disposed immediately to accept its
teachings, and yet at the same time he did not believe that it
was quite fair to ignore the thing altogether. Not a few
men inferred from this hesitating attitude on his part that
he rather favored Brown’s system. As a matter of fact he
was an eclectic in his views and was always ready to appropriate
whatever seemed to him good in any system or school
of doctrines. As Director of the Allgemeine Krankenhaus
he adopted the plan of having the leading physicians and
surgeons of the Clinic first report publicly once a week what
were the important diseases that had come under observation
during that period; and then he would call upon the
auditors to discuss the subject freely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peter Frank died at his home in Vienna on April 24, 1821.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>TWO EMINENT GERMAN SURGEONS OF THE PRE-ANTISEPTIC PERIOD</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach</span>, born in 1794 at Koenigsberg,
an important city of Northern Prussia, received his
early medical education in France; first under Boyer,
Dupuytren, Larrey and Magendie, at Paris, and then later
at Montpellier, under Delpech. After his return to Germany
in 1823 he devoted his efforts largely to surgery, and soon
distinguished himself so greatly in this department of medicine
that in 1840, after the death of Karl von Graefe, he
was chosen his successor in the office of Director of the University
Surgical Clinic at Berlin. His death occurred in
1847.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dieffenbach was universally considered a very clever
operator, particularly in the field of plastic surgery. He
was distinguished by a high degree of manual skill, remarkable
presence of mind under the most trying circumstances,
and boldness combined with prudence. His triumphs in the
reconstruction of damaged parts of the body, effected
largely by the transplantation of flaps of normal skin, were
quite remarkable; he seemed to know just what steps were
required for restoring a mutilated soft palate, ear, nose,
eyelid, etc. But his interest was not confined to plastic surgery;
he also performed successful operations in tenotomy,
myotomy, transfusion of blood, and the injection of drug
infusions into the veins.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'>The Schleswig-Holstein campaign, says George Korn in
his “Progress of Medicine during the Nineteenth Century,”
furnished a great stimulus to the advance of German
surgery, by providing an extensive field for the
activity of such men as von Langenbeck, Stromeyer and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>son-in-law, Esmarch. The scantiness of available space, as
well as of satisfactory sources of information, compels me
to give here only the briefest details concerning these three
distinguished surgeons.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'>The founder of modern German surgery, says George
Korn, was <span class='sc'>Bernhard von Langenbeck</span> (1810–1887). When
he began active work as a surgeon he was already
thoroughly familiar with human anatomy, physiology and
pathology, and with the experimental methods of research.
His first appearance as a teacher was at the University of
Goettingen, where he remained for a few years, and then
moved to Berlin, to occupy the chair of surgery vacated in
1847 by the death of Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach. In
1882 he gave up his professorship in Berlin and retired to
Wiesbaden, where he spent the remainder of his life in
quietude.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before von Langenbeck’s day much stress was laid in
Germany upon the importance of anatomy in its relationship
to the science of surgery. It was a common practice in
the medical schools, for example, to combine in one the two
chairs of anatomy and surgery, and, imbued with the idea
that this viewpoint was the correct one for them to adopt,
the leaders in surgery, with few exceptions, strove to make
advances in their branch of knowledge by cultivating energetically
the study of anatomy. The efforts of von Langenbeck
and his followers, on the other hand, were directed to
giving new life to surgery by calling to its aid physiology,
pathological anatomy and pathological histology, as well
as experiments upon animals, sources of information which
before von Langenbeck’s time had been very little utilized
by the surgeons. Korn, in his comments upon the preceding
statement, begs the reader not to interpret it as signifying
that von Langenbeck permitted himself to neglect anatomy
in the slightest degree. Quite the contrary, he continued to
insist upon it that a knowledge of anatomy was the most
useful foundation upon which a surgeon could build. As
corroborative evidence of the correctness of Korn’s statement
I will quote here the remarks made by an English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>physician who visited Goettingen in 1818 (London Quarterly
Journal of Foreign Medicine and Surgery, Vol. 1,
1818–1819):—</p>

<p class='c017'>We were pleased in observing the great attention which Professor
von Langenbeck paid in these clinical exercises to relative anatomy.
He omitted no opportunity of impressing on the students that the
mere dissection of bodies could never make them good anatomists,
and that, as surgery without the knowledge of anatomy would be
a dangerous art, so anatomy without a constant reference and
application to the living body would be vain and futile....</p>

<p class='c018'>The foundation of the surgical hospital at Goettingen is entirely
due to Professor von Langenbeck. In 1807, at his representations,
a certain sum was appropriated to its support from the Cloister-fund.
In 1808 the professor built the present hospital, which is
still his own property, the Hanoverian Government paying him a
yearly rent for it. The beautiful collection of surgical instruments
also belongs to the professor.... The whole as it now (1818)
stands is undoubtedly the first in Germany. It comprises all instruments
that have ever been used in surgery from the earliest days
to the present time.</p>

<p class='c018'>Professor von Langenbeck, as a practical surgeon, is unrivalled
in Germany. We have seldom seen a man so enthusiastically devoted
to any pursuit, or who brought to the profession of surgery
more capability of excelling in it.... As an operator, he is
unrivalled in his own country, and we are not aware that he is
excelled in any. He is clear and decisive in his judgments.</p>

<p class='c019'>This account certainly places von Langenbeck on a very
high pedestal, and reveals the true reasons of his great
popularity as a teacher. Upon a close analysis these
reasons may be stated thus: they were whole-heartedness
in his chosen work; readiness to sacrifice himself, if necessary,
in order to secure every possible advantage for his
pupils; and the possession of the rare gift of knowing how
best to impart knowledge to those who show a strong desire
to acquire it. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that
von Langenbeck was such a favorite with such pupils as
Hueter, Trendelenburg, Gurlt, Luecke, von Esmarch and
Billroth, all of whom in time acquired celebrity as surgeons.</p>

<p class='c007'>One more point deserves to be mentioned here: von
Langenbeck was an accomplished master in the technique
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>of operative work, and he took pains to transmit his skill
to his pupils. One of his great feats, as narrated by those
who often witnessed incidents of this nature, is briefly described
as follows:—von Langenbeck would appear from
time to time at the operating table dressed in a light summer
suit of clothes, and would immediately proceed to his work
without putting on a gown or taking other measures to
protect himself from the soiling which so frequently is
associated with operative work; and yet, when the operation
was completed, the closest observation failed to discover
a single spot of blood or other pathological product
upon his clothes. The narrator of this tale evidently believed,
and perhaps rightly, that the incident showed how
thoroughly familiar von Langenbeck was with the distribution
of the blood-vessels that supplied the region upon
which he was operating and also how skilful he was in the
handling of his scalpel. The incident, it should be remembered,
occurred many years before it was thought necessary
to take certain precautions against the spread of
infection.</p>

<p class='c014'>A GENERAL SURVEY OF GERMAN MEDICINE AT
THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p class='c005'>Among those who read the present chapter there may be
some who will express surprise at the gloomy character of
the picture which I draw of the state of medical affairs in
Germany at the period of time now under consideration.
In answer to this implied criticism I would state that I am
in no degree responsible for the unpleasant impression
conveyed by the picture, as I have simply reproduced, without
the slightest exaggeration, the account which such
excellent authorities as August Hirsch, of Berlin, and
George Korn, of Munich, give in their published writings.
Furthermore, I have not hesitated to quote, wherever I
could do so without obscuring the clarity of my account,
the actual statements of these authors. However gloomy,
therefore, the picture here presented may appear, this unattractive
characteristic must be attributed to the actual
condition of medical affairs in Germany during the period
named.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'>At the end of the eighteenth century and at the beginning
of the nineteenth culture entered upon an entirely new
phase of development in all parts of the civilized world;
more quickly in certain parts than in others because the
seeds of such development had already begun there to take
root. In this work of development John Locke, the English
philosopher, was a conspicuous leader. His philosophy
formed the starting-point of the new development of the
natural sciences, first in France and afterward in Germany
and other European countries. Voltaire was the first
among the French philosophers to advocate the teachings
of Locke in opposition to those of Descartes (<i>i.e.</i>, realistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>rather than as the result of <i>a priori</i> reasoning). Condillac,
another great French philosopher (1715–1780), also expressed
himself as approving the views set forth by Voltaire,—that
is, in favor of Locke’s philosophy. Diderot
and others among the encyclopaedists sanctioned the same
teachings. As Hirsch expresses it:—</p>

<p class='c017'>These ideas broke like a thunderstorm over the thinking classes
of France and spread rapidly to the other countries; the French
Revolution cleared the atmosphere in all the different walks of life;
it cast off the fetters of feudalism or at least materially loosened
their hold; it greatly increased tolerance of religious beliefs and
placed limits upon superstition.</p>

<p class='c019'>At this period of time Germany was still living under
deplorable conditions. The after-effects of the Thirty
Years’ War still lingered. Those Germans who wished to
lay some claim to culture were obliged to think, speak and
write in French. The great mass of the people, however,
were still bound hand and foot under the dominion of their
spiritual and state tyrants. The learned classes still cultivated
a barbaric Latin in their university lectures and in
their writings. They considered it beneath their dignity to
cultivate their own tongue. In the schools and universities
the teaching had reached a decidedly low ebb. “The
humanistic spirit” had vanished; the teaching was directed
to the acquisition of the science of bread-winning. The
Roman Catholic Church at this time was entirely in the
hands of the Jesuits; the Protestant Church was no longer
guided by the high ideals of its founder. A hollow dogmatism
had put a stop to all further search for the truth;
the one important thing was orthodoxy. There had developed
a Protestant hierarchy that exerted as stupefying
an influence upon the great mass of the people as did the
Jesuits in the Roman Catholic Church. Superstition and
charlatanry permeated the medical profession. These
superstitious beliefs found lodgment in the minds of even
such otherwise great physicians as Friedrich Hoffmann,
Georg Ernst Stahl and Anton de Haen, one of Boerhaave’s
distinguished pupils and a celebrated clinical teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the lapse of a few years—that is, in 1842—there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>was founded a new German periodical, the <i>Archiv für
Physiologische Heilkunde</i>, under the management of
Wunderlich and Roser. According to the Prospectus it
was to be devoted to physiological medicine, or—to be more
precise—to the cultivation of physiological methods in the
treatment of disease. The introductory article in the first
number of this new periodical bore the title: “The Defects
of German Medicine as Taught to-day and the Importance
of Giving it a Decidedly Scientific Tendency.” From the
convincing style in which the article is written there can be
no mistake, says Petersen, in ascribing its authorship to
Karl August Wunderlich (1815–1877), a member of the
Tübingen Faculty of Medicine. The following brief extracts
from this article will suffice to give the reader a fair
idea of this writer’s views on the subject of which he
treats:—</p>

<p class='c017'>We are establishing to-day an organ which is intended to promote
the interests of physiological medicine. Henceforth it should
be the aim of all enlightened minds to place pathology upon a physiological
basis.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Nothing of a dogmatic character may be tolerated
in these pages; every law here promulgated must be accompanied
by proofs showing that it is justified; all the facts, observations
and experiments that have led to its acceptance as a law must form
a part of the account. Although for a long time past the necessity
of following the course here outlined has been appreciated and has
been unostentatiously adopted by all good observers, nevertheless,
it is believed that the time has now come when this important
fundamental truth should be announced loudly and in no uncertain
terms, and should be defended again and again with untiring
energy, until it shall have received universal acceptance....
People are already beginning to make a distinction between the
doctrines taught in the books and those which are derived from a
direct observation of what takes place in nature.... But this
scepticism is only too often based upon mere assumptions and consequently
fails to produce any useful results.... We believe that
the time has at last arrived when this sort of scepticism should be
organized into something like a system, and that intelligent criticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>should persevere in testing the correctness of those observations
which have been cited as actual facts and as the bases upon
which the hitherto prevailing medical theories, so it is claimed,
deserve to receive acceptance.</p>

<p class='c018'>We further believe that to-day is the time when an attempt should
be made to construct, out of the clinical materials that are now in
our possession and that have been brought together with great care
and without bias, <i>a positive science</i>, a science which in the course
of time cannot fail to lead to sound therapeutic methods. This is
what we mean by the expression “<span class='sc'>Physiological Medicine</span>.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Up to this point in his article Wunderlich says nothing to
which any of my readers are likely to object. Quite the
contrary; the first impression which the text makes is something
like this: At last Wunderlich has discovered a road by
following which closely one may eventually develop a
really scientific practical medicine. But, when one reaches
the end of the article, one can scarcely fail to experience no
small degree of disappointment on finding that it does not
furnish the slightest evidence of the manner in which the
author’s seemingly admirable scheme is to be realized;
nor—as we are assured by Petersen—is any further enlightenment
upon this subject to be found in any of the
succeeding volumes, either in the seven which were published
under the joint editorship of Wunderlich and Roser,
or in those which were issued after Wilhelm Griesinger had
been accepted as an associate in the management of the
<i>Archiv</i>. The old evil which carried Broussais as it were
by storm into the dictatorship of medical thinking and of
medical practice in France was here being reëstablished
in Germany. Men seemed to find it impossible to go on
patiently collecting facts; they could not resist the temptation
to build theories first. So far at least as the treatment
of disease is concerned, we are forced to admit that the collecting
of any large body of facts is well-nigh an impossibility.
Only after the lapse of very many years would it be
possible to realize the desirable results which Wunderlich
had in mind.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A short time before his death the Hollander, Gerhard van
Swieten, who was one of the last physicians of European
celebrity to give up the habit of conversing in Latin with
his professional brethren, made the following remark, in a
letter which he wrote to one of his friends in the Medical
Faculty of Halle: “Praxis medica quotidie me convincit
quot et quanta sint quae ignoro.” (In my medical practice
I realize more and more clearly every day how many and
how important are the things concerning which I am
ignorant.) This epigrammatic remark, which throws such
a flood of light upon the character of van Swieten, may
appropriately be placed at the head of the following brief
biographical sketch of this distinguished founder of the
Vienna School of Medicine.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<div class='ic002'>
<p>GERARD FREYHERR VAN SWIETEN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Van Swieten’s Early Professional Career.</span>—Gerhard
van Swieten was born at Leyden, Holland, on May 7, 1700.
His parents, who died while he was still a child, left to him
an ample fortune, which enabled him to obtain an excellent
education. His guardians, however, were either negligent
or quite incompetent to look after his best interests during
the period of youth and early manhood; but, despite this
fact, his own industriousness, his native talents, his ambition
to excel and his purity of mind carried him safely
and creditably through these early years. At the age of
sixteen he entered the High School of Louvain, near Brussels,
and during the following two years the study of Latin
and Greek and of philosophy chiefly engaged his attention.
Then, upon his return to Leyden, he began in earnest to
prepare himself for the career which he had chosen—viz.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that of the practice of medicine. Boerhaave, who, at that
period of time, represented by universal consent the leading
medical authority of the world, was the regular professor of
medicine in the university (1710–1738), and was held in
such high esteem as a teacher that students flocked by hundreds
from all parts of Europe to benefit from his instruction.
Among this number were two young men,—Albrecht
von Haller, of Berne, Switzerland, and the subject of the
present sketch,—both of whom afterward became celebrated
for the important parts which they played in the advancement
of medical science. Boerhaave appears to have taken
a special liking for the latter and to have entertained great
confidence in his ability as a physician. In 1727, when Boerhaave,
by reason of a gouty affection of his legs, began to
experience considerable difficulty in attending to his official
duties in the university, van Swieten, upon whom the degree
of Doctor of Medicine had been conferred only two years
previously, was from time to time authorized by his
superior to lecture in his place. As the years passed by,
and as the pupil showed more and more clearly that he was
entirely competent to perform this important duty in behalf
of his teacher, van Swieten came eventually to be accepted
as the worthy interpreter of Boerhaave’s teachings. This
practice continued for nearly twenty years, and with ever
increasing confidence in and affection for the pupil on the
part of his distinguished teacher. Boerhaave’s death in
1738, however, put an end to van Swieten’s substitute professorship.
All the available evidence goes to show that
Boerhaave hoped that, in the event of his death, van Swieten
would be chosen his successor; but the records of the university
fail to show that the latter held at any time an
official position in the teaching body. During Boerhaave’s
lifetime no opposition of any kind was offered to van
Swieten’s continued yet officially unauthorized occupancy
of the Chair of Medicine, although it was well known that
he was a Roman Catholic; but, after Boerhaave’s death,
the most active opposition to van Swieten’s candidacy was
immediately organized by his rivals. The claim was made
by them that he could not legally be chosen to fill the vacant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>chair, by reason of the fact that the university had been
founded on a Protestant basis and that consequently it
would not be either legal or proper to elect a Roman Catholic
to fill the vacancy. When the personal friends of van
Swieten and a large body of the students begged that,
despite the legal obstacle, he might be chosen the regular
successor of Boerhaave, he himself at once exerted all his
authority to stop the movement. Nevertheless, he felt
keenly the loss of his position in the University of Leyden,
for he loved the work of teaching which he had carried on
so successfully during the previous two decades.</p>

<p class='c007'>Van Swieten’s retirement from the duties of a teacher
in the university brought with it certain important compensations.
In the first place he was now able to devote
himself fully to his private practice which had by this time
grown to be very large, and the way was also opened for
him to begin work at once upon his “Commentaries,”—a
book of which he completed the first volume in 1742, and
which contained matter of decided importance in promoting
an advance in the science of medicine. Some authorities
claim that if one wishes to obtain a clear understanding of
Boerhaave’s teachings, he will have to read van Swieten’s
elaborate work, which in its completed state consists of five
large volumes.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Strange as it may appear, a Dutch translation
of the work has never been published; from which
fact two conclusions are warranted: first, that already as
early as 1754 van Swieten must have severed all connection
with his native land; and, second, that the number of physicians
in Holland who might be tempted to purchase a
Dutch version of the work was undoubtedly very small.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November of the year 1744 van Swieten was called to
Brussels to see, in consultation with her regular medical
attendants, the Archduchess Marianne, wife of Charles
Alexander of Lorraine, and the sister of Maria Theresa,
Empress of Germany. She had recently been confined,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>after having been in poor health for several months before
this event. It was therefore not surprising that at the
delivery, on November 5, the child was found to be dead.
Shortly after the confinement the condition of the Archduchess
became rapidly worse, and it was then that Maria
Theresa sent her own physician, Dr. Engel, from Vienna to
consult with van Swieten and with her sister’s regular
medical attendants. It appears that these two leading physicians
frequently disagreed as to what was the best treatment
to adopt; but van Swieten was so tactful in his
advocacy of the measures which he thought advisable and
so courteous in his intercourse with his professional associates
that Prince Kaunitz, the Imperial Austrian Chancellor,
who happened to be in Brussels at this time, wrote to
the Empress in strongly commendatory terms of the impression
which van Swieten had made upon him. However,
the hope which the latter had held out with regard to the
patient’s ultimate recovery was not realized; she died on
December 12. Notwithstanding his failure to predict correctly
the outcome of the Archduchess’ illness van Swieten
had succeeded so completely in impressing all the patient’s
immediate friends with his skill as a physician and with a
genuine esteem for his personal character that they had
only praise to bestow upon the man in their reports to the
Empress. Maria Theresa’s mind was now entirely made
up as to the wisdom of calling van Swieten to Vienna and
entrusting to him the work of reorganizing the hospital
management and the university medical teaching in her
capital, matters in which she took a very deep interest. As
soon as the decision reached by the Empress became
generally known in Vienna certain physicians of that city
lost no time in taking steps to thwart her plan. Scheming
of this sort, however, had to be done very cautiously, for it
was not safe openly to oppose the will of the sovereign. The
first evidence of the existence of this intrigue to prevent the
appointment of van Swieten to a position of such commanding
importance in the medical world of Vienna appeared
in a Frankfort newspaper of January 9, 1745. After
announcing the death of the Archduchess Marianne at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Brussels the article in question added the following remarks:
“The fatal issue, it appears, is to be attributed to
the unsuccessful treatment that was carried out by the
local physicians with whom van Swieten of Leyden was
associated as the chief consultant; it having been predicted
from the very first by Dr. Engel, the imperial Austrian physician,
that this treatment, if adopted, would terminate
badly.” The Empress closed her ears to this and all
similar calumnious reports, and wrote to van Swieten that
it was her warmest wish that, when he came to Vienna, he
might not experience any unpleasantness. “I would
rather,” she added, “abandon completely my personal
interest in this matter than have you made unhappy by the
contemplated visit to Vienna.” While these gracious words
from the Empress were greatly appreciated by van Swieten
he was not willing to appear in Vienna in the rôle of a
censor or a reformer; and so one is not surprised to learn
that he did not take up his residence in the Austrian capital
before June 7, 1745.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Van Swieten’s Work as a Medical Reformer.</span>—So far
as the teaching of medicine was concerned van Swieten
found everything in the University in a state of confusion;
indeed, nothing worthy the name of medical science existed
in Vienna at that period of time. He had left a city in
which the teaching of this branch of knowledge had reached
a high degree of development and had come to one where
the very foundations of such work had yet to be laid. He
recognized at the first glance just what steps would have
to be taken, and he was much encouraged by the thought
that he could count upon the powerful support which Maria
Theresa was only too glad to give him. According to
Mueller, he realized that the most serious obstacle in his
way was sure to be the very great influence wielded by the
Jesuits, who had for many years controlled all educational
matters in the Austrian Empire. He began his work by
delivering a course of lectures on methods of treatment and
on Boerhaave’s Principles of Medicine (“Institutions”),
and he managed within a comparatively short time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>attract large numbers of auditors, in whose minds was thus
created a strong interest in the personality of the lecturer.
At the same time van Swieten remained conscious of the
fact that many of the members of the Faculty had not ceased
to look upon him with keenly jealous eyes. In his memorial
to the Empress on the progress which had thus far been
made in the study of medicine he wrote: “Although the
Faculty have not included my ‘Commentaries’ in the list of
books which they recommend to the students, they emphasize
by this very act the fact that physicians everywhere—as
shown by the publication of five separate editions and
two translations of my book in only six years—do not agree
with these gentlemen in regard to the value of this work.”
The continued favor shown to van Swieten by the Empress
and the consciousness that he was doing his full share
toward advancing the science of medicine compensated in
large measure for the ungenerous spirit which animated
his colleagues.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Reorganization of the Vienna Medical School.</span>—But
van Swieten rendered valuable services to the university in
other ways than by lecturing, by acting as the Director of
the Royal Library, and by serving as the private physician
of the Empress, its great patron. For example, it was his
duty, after a certain time had elapsed, to select additional
professors for the Medical Department, and in this work
he also manifested excellent judgment; but he was not
called upon to exercise this particular function until after
he had been settled in Vienna for about four years. As
the first step in building up the teaching force van Swieten
invited Anton de Haen (1703–1776), a native of Leyden and
one of Boerhaave’s former pupils, to carry on the clinical
teaching which he himself had already in some measure
organized at the university. Speaking of de Haen’s qualifications
for this important office, Hecker, the author of a
history of modern medicine and a person entirely competent
to pass judgment upon a matter of this kind, makes
the following comments: “Vienna has seen few teachers as
well fitted as de Haen for inspiring enthusiasm and for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>making clinical teaching effective, and few so capable as he
was of showing his auditors with persuasive force how they
should study Nature by direct observation, and not from
books or lectures. Possessing no inclination whatever to
indulge in social pleasures or in amusements of any kind,
he found his chief enjoyment in tireless work. Knowledge
was the priceless treasure which, by the aid of an unfailing
memory and remarkable skill, he sought to win. Possessing,
as he did, a quick temper, he became at times very angry
under even slight provocation. Although such outbursts
of temper did not conduce to his popularity they enabled
him to boast that he had attained his lofty position wholly
through merit, and not—as was in some measure true of
van Swieten—through abstention from self-assertion.”
Despite all his faults, adds Hecker, de Haen was a great
physician and an extraordinarily clever teacher. He gained
considerable reputation from the treatise which he published
under the title: “Ratio Medendi” (The Philosophy
of Treatment). He was a violent opponent of the practice
of inoculation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next six men selected by van Swieten were also distinguished
teachers, well fitted to uphold the growing celebrity
of the Vienna Medical School. They were: Anton von
Stoerck, commonly spoken of as van Swieten’s favorite
pupil; Maximilian Stoll, one of de Haen’s pupils; Lorenz
Grasser;<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Heinrich Crantz, another of van Swieten’s talented
pupils; Robert Laugier; and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin.
While the addition of these unquestionably strong names to
the list of professors in the medical department of the university
was recognized as a move in the right direction, the
retention of a few incompetent teachers led to considerable
worry on the part of van Swieten. Although he was convinced
that it would be better for the University to get rid
of these men he did not dare to act on his own responsibility,
fearing the disturbance that was likely to result from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>dismissal. Maria Theresa, to whom the situation was fully
explained, begged him not to hesitate any longer, but to
take whatever steps seemed best for the good of the university
and the public. Thus encouraged, van Swieten proceeded
to remove first one and then another of the men who
seriously interfered with his plans for improving the teaching
in the Medical School. In 1757, on the death of Archbishop
Trautson, who held the position of “Protector of the
Studies in the University,” this office was abolished.
Already in the preceding year, at van Swieten’s suggestion,
the Rector of the Jesuits was no longer permitted by the
Empress to take part in the regular conferences of the Consistory
of the University. Gradually other members of the
Jesuit Order were excluded from the management of the
affairs of the University. Finally, in 1759, van Swieten
accepted the office of Censor of Medical and Philosophical
Writings, and up to the day of his death he performed the
duties of his office most satisfactorily to all concerned.
Thus was he made the virtual Commander-in-Chief of the
teaching forces in the Vienna Medical School.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the changes described above were taking place the
Empress, under the inspiration given by van Swieten, inaugurated
certain improvements in the housing and equipment
of the Medical School. In 1752 she gave the necessary
orders for constructing a new building that was to contain
a fine anatomical theatre, a chemical laboratory, lecture
rooms for the different professors, a general assembly hall,
etc. This fine structure was completed and formally
inaugurated in April, 1756.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, all the hospitals in Vienna were greatly improved
during this period of time, not only as regards their
accommodations and equipment, but also in respect to their
management.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Inauguration of Clinical Teaching.</span>—As the sequel
showed, Vienna, under the inspiring cooperation of the
Empress, continued for a long series of years the Mecca
toward which physicians and medical students turned their
steps from all parts of Central and Northern Europe and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>even from the United States of America and from Canada.
It is now universally recognized that this extraordinary
popularity of the Vienna Medical School, which began
toward the middle of the eighteenth century and has continued
almost up to the present time, was chiefly due to the
clinical teaching which de Haen inaugurated at van
Swieten’s suggestion. Sylvius and, after him, Boerhaave
had already given this method a trial at Leyden, but for
various reasons it had not proved entirely satisfactory.
De Haen’s plan was to let each student, at the bedside of
the patient, make his own diagnosis and then whisper it to
the professor, who in turn announced it to the remainder
of the class. If the diagnosis proved to be correct the professor
found it unnecessary to say anything additional on
the subject; but, if it happened to be incorrect, he presented
the truth to the class in such a manner as not to give the
slightest offence to the student who had committed the
error. This plan encouraged his pupils to feel confidence
that, whenever they made an erroneous diagnosis, they
would not be subjected to ridicule on the part of their classmates.
This exercise in diagnosis was duly followed by an
exposition of the treatment adopted; and, whenever it
happened that a patient whose case had been studied by the
class, subsequently died, a post-mortem examination was
conducted in their presence, and appropriate explanatory
remarks were made by the instructor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In further explanation of the extraordinary popularity
which the clinical teaching at Vienna attained it is interesting
to learn that de Haen (and probably also Stoll, who
succeeded him) was in the habit of rising at an early hour
that he might visit the hospital and learn, in advance of the
arrival of the students, how the patients in the section set
apart for teaching purposes were getting on, how their condition
differed from that which they presented at the time
of his visit on the preceding day, and what special provision,
if any, should be made for the approaching clinical
lesson. In short, no pains were spared to make each <i>séance</i>
as attractive and as instructive as possible to the students.</p>

<p class='c007'>While I am here giving to de Haen and Stoll all the credit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>that is their due for the very wise and skilful manner in
which they carried out the teaching of medicine at Vienna
it must be remembered that van Swieten was the real
founder of clinical instruction in the famous university; de
Haen and Stoll having simply put in practice the ideas
introduced by him.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point in my sketch the question may with propriety
be asked, Where may one find in history another
instance of such beneficent interference on the part of a
queen in behalf of a higher standard of medical education?
Certain it is that, without the powerful and sympathetic
assistance which Maria Theresa granted him at every stage
of his work, van Swieten could not have accomplished in so
short a period of time the extraordinary results which I
have here briefly recorded.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Van Swieten’s Contributions to Therapeutics</span>.—In his
treatment of disease van Swieten practiced conservative
methods and prescribed remedies with great caution and
with strong common sense. In the case of small-pox, for
instance, he did not approve of the practice of inoculation
as a method of diminishing the mortality of that disease or
possibly of rendering the severity of its manifestations less
pronounced. He evidently believed the attendant risk to
be too great. It was particularly in his treatment of
syphilis, however, that he accomplished results of a most
beneficial character. In St. Mark’s Hospital, in which
patients affected with this disease were lodged, it had been
the rule—previous to the date of van Swieten’s arrival in
Vienna—to subject all the cases, without regard to the
severity of the infection, to a course of mercurial salivation.
As a natural result of this plan of treatment it happened
not infrequently that a patient’s life was severely threatened
or that he was left with lifelong sequelae of a lamentable
character. The physician under whose management
this mode of treatment flourished was dismissed from his
position by van Swieten as soon as he was able to overcome
the obstacles which stood in his way as he advanced toward
the accomplishment of this end. Maximilian Locher, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>was put in charge of the hospital after the dismissal of his
predecessor, was instructed to use a solution of the bichloride
of mercury in the treatment of the cases that came
under his care; and the results that followed were so astonishingly
good that the remedy soon came to be known
everywhere as “Swieten’s” liquor.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> For many subsequent
years this solution retained its popularity among European
physicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the other remedies which van Swieten was in
the habit of employing in his treatment of various maladies
it is stated that he clung persistently to those advocated by
Boerhaave and enumerated at the end of Vol. V of the Commentaries,—remedies
which were characterized by their
simplicity and by the fewness of the ingredients that entered
into their composition.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Van Swieten’s Contributions to Medical Literature.</span>—In
addition to his famous “Commentaries” van Swieten
wrote only one other treatise to which it seems desirable to
call the reader’s attention. I refer to the book that bears
the title “<i>Constitutiones Epidemicae</i>” and that was first
published by Stoll after the author’s death. According to
the statement of Mueller “this work is a sort of ‘Physician’s
Day-Book,’ covering the period 1727–1744, and reveals the
fact that van Swieten was a very close observer of the
different diseases that came under his notice.... It constitutes
a valuable supplement to the history of Boerhaave’s
therapeutic methods.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, it should be stated, on the authority of Hecker,
that van Swieten wrote a small manual for the use of military
surgeons. It was published by Johann Thomas Trattnern,
Court Printer and Bookseller, Vienna, Prague and
Trieste, 1758. Van Swieten’s name—says Hecker—does
not appear anywhere in the volume; and, furthermore,
serious doubts have been expressed as to the correctness
of the claim that van Swieten is the author of this little
manual.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>After van Swieten’s death in 1772, the bust of this distinguished
physician, which already three years earlier the
sculptor F. X. Messerschmied had been commissioned by
the Empress to prepare, was set up in the auditorium of
the Medical School; and in addition an elaborate monument
in his honor was erected in the <i>Hofkirche</i>, the Royal Chapel.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>ANTON STOERCK, VAN SWIETEN’S SUCCESSOR,
AND THE PROGRESS OF MEDICAL AFFAIRS
AT VIENNA UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF
JOSEPH II.</p>
<p class='c005'>After the death of Maria Theresa, in 1780, her son Joseph,
who had previously been associated with his mother in the
government of the empire, became the Emperor in the full
sense of that term. Fortunately for the best interests of the
science and art of medicine he had long been familiar, and
fully in sympathy, with the plans and purposes of Maria
Theresa; and he was therefore quite ready to advance the
good work which she had begun. One of his first acts was
to remove every possible disability from those officers and
instructors who were non-Catholics, thus enabling them to
gain all the facilities and honors which their Catholic associates
had up to that time enjoyed. In their ultimate effect
upon the growth and prosperity of the university these
special measures undoubtedly were advantageous, but they
were carried out with too great rapidity. According to
Puschmann the Emperor strove to accomplish in a comparatively
short period of time what required not less than a
century. His efforts met with strong opposition in certain
quarters, and before his death in 1790 he had the disheartening
experience of witnessing the upsetting of many of his
cherished plans. After his death, however, he received full
credit for what he had attempted; the Viennese speaking
of him as “the friend of the poor and the miserable, the
upholder of justice and the champion of spiritual freedom
and of education.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Anton Stoerck and the Manner of Teaching Medicine
in the University of Vienna.</span>—Anton Stoerck, van Swieten’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>successor, was the first to enjoy in large measure the
fruits of the latter’s reformation of medical teaching in
Vienna. His elder brother, Melchior, had already before
this date been appointed Professor of Theoretical Medicine
in the University; and then, in 1760, Anton himself was
elevated to the important position of Court Physician. He
gained his chief distinction, however, through his enthusiastic
cultivation of experimental pharmacology. In this
field, which had previously received very little attention,
he was probably the first to appreciate the fact that the gap
between theoretical medicine and actual practice could be
bridged only by a resort to experimentation. Among the
drugs which he tested in this manner were the following:
datura stramonium, hyoscyamus niger L., clematis erecta
and pulsatilla nigricans L. Van Swieten, so long as his
state of health permitted, encouraged Anton to go on with
his experimental work; de Haen, on the other hand, was
rather skeptical about the success of his efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ultimately—after van Swieten’s death—Anton Stoerck
became the leading spirit in the affairs of the Vienna medical
world. The instruction in medicine was graded by him,
with the Emperor’s consent, in the following manner: The
medical students, before they were permitted to begin the
course of instruction, were obliged to furnish satisfactory
evidence of possessing adequate general scientific knowledge
and of having previously attended lectures in natural
history and experimental physics. In the next place, they
were further obliged to attend the lectures on botany, chemistry,
anatomy and physiology, and to pass a satisfactory
examination in these branches before they were permitted
to take up the study of pathology and materia medica. It
was only after having passed a satisfactory examination in
these subjects that they were allowed to receive clinical instruction.
At the final examination they were called upon
to make a report on a few cases of actual disease and to set
forth especially the details of the treatment adopted; to
write a certain number of prescriptions; and, finally, to
defend publicly, in the presence of the Rector and the Chancellor
of the University, the Deans of the four Faculties, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>one Professor of the Medical School, a thesis on some medical
doctrine. After which the formal ceremonial of conferring
the degree was carried out in the presence of the same
university officials. And here again, the Emperor effected
a most marked reformation; he abolished all those religious
ceremonies which it had been customary to observe in connection
with the bestowal of the degree of M.D. and the right
to practice medicine. He also adopted measures for enlarging
the equipment of the University libraries, and among
other things he abolished a large number of monasteries and
turned over their collections of books to the libraries of the
university. Recognizing, as he did, the fact that the proper
training of medical men who intended to follow the career
of surgeons was at that time lamentably inadequate, he
instituted, at the earliest moment practicable, such changes
in the teaching, in the duration of the course, in the requirements
for graduation, etc., that the surgeons would thereafter
be on the same level, with regard to education and
practical training, as the physicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first (1780), the Faculty consisted of nine professors,
who gave instruction in the following branches: anatomy,
physiology, natural history, chemistry and botany, general
pathology and therapeutics (including pharmaceutics),
internal medicine and clinical instruction, theoretical surgery,
clinical surgery, and obstetrics. In addition to these
there were several assistants and a prosector (demonstrator
of anatomy). The Emperor Joseph II., after expressing
serious doubts with regard to the “possibility of teaching
the theory of surgery, bandaging and the various surgical
operations in six months,” gave orders that the following
scheme should be adopted:—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>First Year</span>: Anatomy and physiology, together with chemistry
and botany (for physicians only) and operative work, bandaging
and obstetrics (for surgeons only).</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Second Year</span>: (For physicians) Materia medica, pathology and
clinical medicine.</p>

<p class='c018'>(For surgeons) Clinical medicine, clinical surgery, and obstetrics.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Third Year</span>: Entirely given up to practical work at the hospital
and the Clinic.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>At a later date the course was extended to four years; and
from that time forward, according to Puschmann, surgeons
were looked upon with consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hirsch, speaking of the majority of physicians of that
period, says that they sought to quiet the demands of the
public for satisfactory information about their maladies by
employing, in their responses, the meaningless terms of
Graeco-Latin terminology; and he quotes Immanuel Kant,
the famous Prussian metaphysician, as having expressed
the same idea when he said: “These men thought they were
rendering their patients a great service when they gave
them a name for their disease.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the therapeutic measures which these so-called
physicians employed, Hirsch adds: “they generally
consisted of pills and plasters, drugs of various kinds, clysters
and repeated blood-lettings which at times produced
such a degree of exhaustion that only patients with a strong
constitution were able to rally from the effects of this loss
of blood.... The title ‘Doctor of Medicine’ afforded no
guarantee that the individual who bore it possessed the
requisite degree of medical knowledge.” Fortunately for
the public there were at that time in almost every community
a few men to whom the description given above does
not in the slightest degree apply. I have already mentioned
the names of several physicians of this higher stamp, and
the number of such honorable representatives of our profession
rapidly increases as we approach the nineteenth
century.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Reorganization of the Hospital Work in Vienna
toward the End of the Eighteenth Century.</span>—In the preceding
sections mention has been made of the important
changes effected by the Emperor Joseph II. in the scheme
of teaching adopted by the Medical Department of the University.
It now remains for me to give some account of
his reorganization of the Vienna hospitals and of his founding
that famous general hospital known as <i>Das Allgemeine
Krankenhaus</i>. That there was need of reorganization in
at least some of the hospitals is shown by the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>anecdote which is related of Professor Boer, who held the
Chair of Obstetrics. When the authorities who had special
charge of the Lying-in Ward complained to him that he prescribed
too liberal a diet for this class of patients, he replied
somewhat impatiently that he could not feed, “with water,
Epsom salts and ‘Arcanum Duplicatum’ [a secret remedy
that was popularly believed to be efficacious], the women
who were already a good deal weakened by their pregnant
state as well as by sorrow, anxiety and insufficient nourishment;
for a liberally supplied kitchen and a good wine
cellar were more important than drugs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To furnish a complete and satisfactory description of <i>Das
Allgemeine Krankenhaus</i> would require more space than
can properly be devoted here to the consideration of this
single topic. Those who take a special interest in the subject
will find full details in Puschmann’s monograph (See
<a href='#PUSCHMANN'>Bibliography</a>); for the majority of readers the following
brief account will probably suffice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Allgemeine Krankenhaus</i> consists of a very large
group of three-story buildings in which there are numerous
individual spaces large enough to serve as wards, as small
lecture rooms, or as reception rooms for ambulant patients
(eye, ear, throat, skin and minor surgical cases). The ceilings
are usually high and the openings for windows are of
such dimensions as to furnish excellent ventilation and
liberal daylight illumination. Ample facilities are provided
for bathing, for cooking the needed food, and for preparing
and dispensing remedies; and the individual buildings are
grouped in such a manner as to afford numerous small park-like
spaces in which the patients may obtain outdoor exercise
or may enjoy the fresh air and some social intercourse with
their fellows. Although in 1784 the buildings were almost
ready for occupancy and the park-like surroundings completed,
it was only at a much later date that the institution
was really prepared for the reception of patients. Somewhere
about the year 1830 it had been so thoroughly organized
that physicians and students came from different parts
of the world, and especially from Great Britain and from
America, to enjoy fully those extraordinary facilities for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the study of every possible form of disease which were to
be obtained only in the city of Vienna. Whereas in London,
New York, Philadelphia and Boston, it was necessary at
that time for all but a few of the students to waste many
precious hours and much physical strength in traveling
from one hospital to another in order to acquire by direct
observation some familiarity with disease, here in Vienna
was provided, in a single group of buildings, ample provision
for all the clinical teaching that the most eager and
serious student of medicine could possibly desire.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>New Methods of Diagnosis, and First Appearance of
Instructors in Special Departments of Medicine at
Vienna.</span>—It was during van Swieten’s lifetime that Auenbrugger’s
new invention “for detecting, by means of percussion,
the obscure diseases of the chest,” was published
for the first time (1761) in Vienna. The value of this discovery,
which was termed by him “Novum Inventum,” was
not appreciated by physicians at that time. Even van
Swieten and de Haen rather looked down on the method;
and its importance was not fully recognized until Corvisart,
the celebrated Paris physician, published a French translation
of Auenbrugger’s book in 1808. This work, in which
Corvisart gave his own experience and added many notes
and comments, served to popularize Auenbrugger’s method
as a valuable aid to diagnosis in affections of the chest. In
his preface Corvisart announced that he was well aware of
the small glory that came to translators and to those who
simply comment on the work of others, but notwithstanding
this fact he preferred that the major part of the glory
should go to Auenbrugger who had rendered such a great
service to the Profession by his invention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Auenbrugger, who died in 1809 at the age of 87, lived long
enough to enjoy the pleasure of this triumph. His private
practice grew to be very large, and he performed, more
often than any other physician of his time, the operation
of thoracentesis. He was universally loved and respected
in Vienna.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>One of the first specialties to take root in Vienna toward
the end of the eighteenth century was that of ophthalmology,
and the physician who first succeeded in bringing it to a
high stage of development was <span class='sc'>George Joseph Beer</span>, who
was born at Vienna in 1763. During his student days and
for a short time subsequently he acted as a draughtsman
for Joseph Barth, the professor of anatomy and physiology
in the Vienna University, and in this way he obtained unusual
opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of both the
normal and the pathological anatomy of the eye. Already
in 1793 he applied for, and was granted, permission to treat,
in the <i>Allgemeine Krankenhaus</i>, such poor people as were
suffering from cataract, and to perform the requisite operations.
Each year, during the months of May and June, a
suitable room was gotten ready for Beer in the hospital,
and here, during this most favorable season of the year,
he performed many cataract operations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1812 he received the double appointment of Director
of the Eye Clinic and Professor Extraordinary of Ophthalmology;
and from this time forward he rapidly gathered
about him a great crowd of pupils, among whom were men
who—like C. F. von Graefe, Philip von Walther, T. W. G.
Benedict, F. Jaeger, Rosas, Quadri, J. N. Fischer, Mackenzie,
Reisinger, Chelius and others—were soon to be known
in every part of Austria, Germany, Italy and England as
the leading eye surgeons of their respective countries. Beer
therefore exerted a most decided influence on the development
of ophthalmology.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beer’s early writings, the first of which date from the
year 1791, also exerted a great influence. Such, for example,
were his “Practical Observations on the Gray Form of
Cataract” and on the “Different Eye Diseases which Owe
their Origin to Some General Disease”; and also his “Treatise
on Diseases of the Eyes.” The last-named passed
through several enlarged and improved editions between
1813 and 1817. In 1799 he issued a Summary of all the treatises
on ophthalmological topics which had been published
up to the end of 1797; and soon afterward he published an
account of his method of extracting a gray cataract together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>with its capsule. Still other memoirs of decided value were
published by him in the following years; and among them
one especially deserves to be mentioned, viz., that on the
affliction known as “Pannus,” of which condition he was
the first to give a correct explanation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1819 Beer was stricken with an illness of a serious
nature, and two years later he died. He was succeeded by
Anton Rosas, whose death occurred in 1855.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>PROCHASKA, HYRTL AND ROKITANSKY, THREE
OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED TEACHERS AT
THE MEDICAL SCHOOL OF VIENNA DURING
THE EARLY PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>George Prochaska</span>, born at Lipsitz, Moravia, in 1749, was
appointed Professor of Anatomy and Ophthalmology at the
Prague Medical School in 1778. Eight years later he was
transferred to the Chair of Physiology. In 1791 he received
the appointment of Professor of Higher Anatomy and
Physiology in the University of Vienna. In 1819 he resigned
this chair, probably owing to poor health; and his death
occurred during the following year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between 1780 and 1797 he published, in Latin, important
monographs on the physiology of man. Later, these were
thoroughly revised and then published in German under the
title of “Physiology, or the Doctrine of the Nature of Man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Prochaska was esteemed very highly as an eye surgeon
of exceptional skill and wide experience, no fewer than 3000
cataract operations having been performed by him. His
greatest achievements, however, belong in the domain of
physiology. Already as early as in 1797 he hinted at the
possibility that, in the case of the spinal nerves, one of the
portions might transmit centripetal and the other centrifugal
impulses. It was reserved, however, for the great
English physiologist, Sir Charles Bell, to establish firmly,
several years later, the law governing these two currents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prochaska’s ideas with regard to the nature of “vital
force”—that question which in those days gave biologists
so much trouble—may be inferred from the following
quotations:—</p>

<p class='c017'>In the performances of the nervous system there occur manifestations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>which bear a striking resemblance to the phenomena produced
by electricity.... In my opinion it is not permissible to conceive
of vital force as an independent power, one that depends upon a
single and special principle, but rather as an aggregation of all the
forces of Nature, representing in one set of instances the cause and
in another set the effect of these forces, and combining in this body
of ours, by their foreordained harmony, to create what we call life.
Therefore, among the powers that are commonly meant when we
use the expression “vital power,” there are no specific forces, but
only the general forces which exist in Nature; but at the same time
they are combined under a special relationship,—in fact, they are
entangled the one with the other in such an inextricable snarl that
it is simply impossible for us to gain a clear conception of their
causes and effects.</p>

<p class='c019'>Finally, it is quite remarkable, says Puschmann, how
closely Prochaska’s ideas regarding the formation of bone
agree with the teachings of our modern authorities. Here
is the paragraph in which he formulates these ideas in full
detail:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The business of nutrition is carried on in such a manner that,
when new conditions arise, whole organs which for some time previously
were performing useful work, are swept out of existence,
and new ones, better adapted to the work required of them, are put
in their places. As an instance in point we may mention certain
cartilages which, for a limited period of time during childhood,
take the place of bone structures, and which at the same time play
the part of really necessary aids to the growth of the bone. These
cartilages gradually become converted into the latter tissue, the
process reaching the stage of completion at different times, but
yet at a fixed and definite time for each particular bone. Thus, in
the case of the long bones, the cartilage becomes completely ossified
somewhere between the twenty-second and the twenty-fourth year.
This process of ossification does not consist in a simple hardening
or change of the cartilage into bone; the essential features of the
process may more correctly be described as follows: the cartilage,
in the depths of whose substance bone-tissue centres are being nourished
and are progressively undergoing development, is steadily
being crowded to one side and ultimately destroyed. At the same
time there appear here and there in the cartilage a few blood-vessels
which, so far as one is able to judge, spring, in the majority
of instances, from the neighboring fully-formed bone substance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>And, as a further stage in the process of growth, there appear
alongside the new blood-vessels centres of ossification, which in due
time become foci of genuine bone tissue. Then, as these foci
increase in size, the surrounding cartilage steadily dwindles in
quantity until nothing remains but a few scattered cavities or
hollows, which persist for only a short time before they disappear
altogether.</p>

<p class='c019'>Prochaska’s discoveries in regard to the growth of bone
excited the admiration of his contemporaries, and well they
might, for they involved prolonged investigations with the
aid of the microscope and much close and careful thinking.
It is safe to say that at this early date (end of the eighteenth
century) original investigations like the one just described
must have been very few indeed in Austria.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Carl Rokitansky</span>, who was born at Koeniggratz, Bohemia,
in 1804, received his medical training at the universities
of Prague and Vienna. For several years after he
had been given the degree of Doctor of Medicine he served
as an Assistant in the Pathologico-Anatomical Institute,
and in 1832, after the death of Johann Wagner, the Custodian
of the Museum that formed a part of the Institute, he
was appointed his successor, not only in this particular
office but also in those which were closely related to it—viz.,
the office of Prosector of the Allgemeine Krankenhaus and
that of Judicial Anatomist for the City of Vienna. The
duties which he had to perform in connection with these
offices and as an Instructor in the Medical Faculty of the
University left him very little time for anything else. His
pet ambition was, not merely to do well the work which these
different official positions entailed upon him, but also to
build up, so far as in his power lay, a systematized knowledge
of the relationship that subsists between the different
pathological conditions revealed at the post-mortem examination
and the clinical phenomena manifested during the
patient’s lifetime. Therefore he was accustomed to insist
that a reasonably full history of the case should be submitted
with every corpse on which he was asked to make a post-mortem
examination. This afterward became a firmly fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>practice at the hospital. After he had read these case-histories
and had compared them with the facts revealed by
the corresponding autopsies he prepared, at proper intervals,
a report on the diseases which were then prevalent at
the hospital. This method of procedure, it will easily be
seen, constituted an important advance beyond the practice
of simply studying and then recording the various pathological
lesions which develop in the different organs of the
body. It established a connecting link between these lesions
and the lifetime manifestations of disease; in other words,
it revealed a way in which the medical practitioner at the
bedside might, by a proper use of his reasoning powers,
infer from the symptoms and physical signs what changes
were taking place in the unseen organs of the body. From
this time forward, therefore, physicians began to place
before their mental vision—in every case which they were
called upon to treat—a picture of the anatomical changes
that were taking place in the patient’s body, instead of
symptom groups. In the words of that distinguished
Tübingen physician, Wunderlich, “Rokitansky was endeavoring
with untiring zeal to convert pathological anatomy
into an anatomical pathology.” The reader will, I am confident,
agree with me when I say that there are very few
instances in the history of medicine where an advance
toward a better knowledge of the art of diagnosis is more
clearly revealed than in the work which Rokitansky carried
on so patiently, so conscientiously and so successfully during
the early years of the nineteenth century. Compare the
record of the work accomplished by Morgagni with the
remarkable results reached by the Vienna pathologist, and
it will be quickly appreciated how little fitted the former
searcher after truth was to carry out successfully the
advance which Rokitansky effected and which I have tried
to describe in these pages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rokitansky’s earliest contributions to medical literature
consisted in quite a large number of memoirs which were
published at different times in the “<i>Medicinische Jahrbücher
des Oestreichischen Staates</i>.” They deal with topics
like the following: “Incarcerations and Intussusceptions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the Intestines”; “New Formations of Bone on the Internal
Surface of the Skull in Pregnant Women”; “Spontaneous
Rupture of the Aorta”; “So-called Duplication of the
Uterus”; “Strictures of the Intestinal Canal and Other
Abnormal Conditions that give rise to Constipation and to
Ileus”; “Perforating Gastric Ulcer”; “Contributions to
our Knowledge of the Different Forms of the Curvature of
the Spine”; etc. Subsequently he published in three volumes
his great work on Pathological Anatomy; Vol. 3
appearing in 1842 and Vol. 2 in 1844. These last two volumes
were devoted to special pathological anatomy. The
first volume of the series, which deals with general pathological
anatomy, was not published until the year 1846. In
these volumes, which are rich in newly discovered facts, the
author keeps constantly in mind the needs of the general
practitioner; and how great was the importance which he
attached to this feature of his work may be inferred from
the frequent reference which he makes to it in other parts
of his writings. Thus, for example, in the Preface to Vol. 1
he says: “In regard to the manner in which I have planned
and constructed the present treatise I will briefly remark:
‘I have tried from the very beginning, and all through the
work, to look at the subject from the viewpoint of the practicing
physician, and I believe that, in adopting this course,
I have accomplished a thing which was most urgently
needed in our time; and I also believe that I have utilized
the gigantic mass of material that was at my disposal in a
worthy manner.’” Then, again, farther on in the Introduction,
he says: “The first attempt to treat the subject of
pathological anatomy in the manner which I have just
described,”—an attempt, by the way, that was crowned with
brilliant success,—“was made by Laënnec in his discussion
of the subject of diseases of the chest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In strong corroboration of Rokitansky’s belief in the importance
of pathological anatomy stands the statement
attributed to the celebrated anatomist Vesalius, to wit: “I
am very sorry not to have devoted to pathological anatomy
the large amount of time and strength which I spent on
physiological anatomy.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Rudolf Virchow calls Rokitansky the “Linnaeus of pathological
anatomy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was my original intention to furnish at this point a
few brief extracts from the original text of Rokitansky’s
great treatise, in order that the reader might learn, from
this pathologist’s own words, just how he managed to teach
pathological anatomy in the manner best adapted to subserve
the interests of the practitioner. After looking in
vain, however, for a section of the desired degree of shortness,
I came to the conclusion that it would be better to
abandon the attempt altogether and rest satisfied with a
simple enumeration of the captions of some of the more
important subsections that treat of alterations in bone.
Here are those which I selected: “Bone Deficiency and Bone
Excess”; “Anomalies in Size and Shape”; “Bone
Atrophy”; “Anomalies of Bone in its Connection with
other Bones”; “Anomalies in Consistence”; “Break in
Continuity and the Manner in which Healing Takes Place”;
“Callus Formation and New Joints”; “Healing of Bone
by First Intention”; “Healing of Bone through the Medium
of Suppuration”; “Healing of Wounds in Bone with Loss
of Substance”; “Inflammation of Bone”; and “Bone
Caries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not being specially interested in pathological anatomy I
have read only small portions of the text of this celebrated
treatise; but, judging from this superficial examination and
from the unanimous testimony given by men who are expert
judges in this department of medical science, I feel confident
that satisfactory answers will be found in this great work to
nearly every question that may arise in a physician’s mind
concerning the pathology of some part of the human body.
It is a book, however, that is intended for reference purposes,
and not for reading as one would read Trousseau’s
work; and this undoubtedly explains why, so far as I am
able to discover, no English version of this treatise exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>I may here call attention to the fact that the first edition
(1842–1846) of Rokitansky’s treatise contains no cuts, but
that of 1855 is well furnished with illustrations.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Rokitansky had held for ten years the position of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Professor Extraordinary of Pathological Anatomy in the
University of Vienna he was promoted in 1844 to that of
Ordinary Professor.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an evidence of Rokitansky’s popularity as a teacher I
will mention the following fact. In my student days at the
College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, my father,
the late Dr. Gurdon Buck, frequently referred to the benefit
which he had derived from the lectures and dead-house
instruction which he received from Rokitansky during his
stay in Vienna (about 1833 or 1834). From the statement
made by Prof. Alfred C. Post of New York, I learn
that he and my father were Rokitansky’s first American
pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rokitansky’s death occurred in 1878.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Joseph Hyrtl</span> was born at Eisenstadt, Hungary, in 1811.
His father was a professional musician (<i>Capellmeister</i>)
in the service of Prince Esterhazy. He received his medical
training in Vienna, and in 1833, while he was still only a
student in the university, he was given the appointment of
Prosector in the Anatomical Institute. Two years later he
received his doctor’s degree, and in 1837 he was chosen
Professor of Anatomy at the University of Prague. According
to Puschmann “Hyrtl handled his pen with the same
skill as he did the scalpel, and also in his spoken lectures he
manifested to a wonderful degree the gift of making dry
facts interesting to his auditors, thus keeping them fascinated
by his remarks and stimulated to advance in that
branch of medical science. The remarkable manner in which
the teaching in the Vienna Medical School increased in
popularity at this period of its history was in no small
degree due to the fact that Hyrtl had, a short time before
(in 1845), been called to occupy the chair of anatomy in that
institution.” In confirmation of Puschmann’s estimate of
Hyrtl’s power to write entertainingly upon anatomical and
physiological topics which are commonly classed as “dry”
I will furnish here a few extracts from Hyrtl’s General
Treatise on Anatomy. And, if the reader will pardon me
for referring once more to my father’s interest in those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>played a part, either as teacher or as simple friend and
companion, in his student life at Vienna, I will preface these
extracts with the statement that, more than once in the early
sixties, I surprised my father reading with evident pleasure,
after the day’s work was over, this very treatise on
anatomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his preface Hyrtl says: “A general treatise on anatomy
should not confine itself to the mere teaching of this
branch of the science of medicine, but should also inspire
the students who read the book with a love for this science
and the ambition to make original investigations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking about the behavior of an artery after it has been
divided with the knife Hyrtl explains why, in the living
body, the complete division of such a blood-vessel produces
a narrowing of the lumen at the point where it has been
divided, whereas a similar division of the vessel, if carried
out upon the dead body, results only in a retraction of the
tube in the direction of its length; in other words, in the
corpse the diameter of the lumen remains unchanged as a
result of such division. From these and other facts (which
he mentions, but which the lack of space compels me to
omit) Hyrtl draws the inference that the contractility of the
wall of an artery is a phenomenon that occurs only in the
living vessel. Then he goes on to remark:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Beginning at the point where the ligature has been applied the
artery loses its symmetrical shape, both above and below the site
of the ligature, as far as to the spot where the next collateral
branch is given off. At first this distortion of the vessel’s shape is
due simply to the fact that its calibre is filled with clotted blood
(provisional obliteration). Later, a solid plug takes the place of
the soft clot. It is composed of plastic material that, becoming
fused with the clot (thrombus), gradually undergoes organization
and permanently attaches itself to the wall of the artery through
actual growth of tissue (definitive obliteration). Thus there is
formed, as the final result of all these changes, a firm and solid
cord the circumference of which is smaller than that of the artery
from which it springs in direct continuity.</p>

<p class='c018'>The ligating of one of the larger arteries—as, for example, the
brachial or the crural artery—does not interfere seriously with the
circulation in the parts located below the point where the ligature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>has been applied; for the blood continues to flow into these parts
although with diminished energy, owing to the fact that it is obliged
to travel through roundabout channels (anastomoses).... I once
owned a dog upon whom, in the days of my youthful sinning in
the domain of physiological experimentation, I performed, within
the short period of a single year, the operations of tying the innominate
artery and both crural arteries; and, notwithstanding the fact
that the blood needed by the adjoining regions was thereby forced
to travel to them by unaccustomed routes, the dog’s health did not
seem to be in any way affected.</p>

<p class='c019'>Among the anatomical remarks which Hyrtl makes at
various points in the course of his formal treatment of the
subject under consideration I find several that seem to me
to be worthy of reproduction here. In one place, for
instance, he makes the statement that voluntary movements
of the auricle of the ear are by no means a rare phenomenon,
and in support of this statement he quotes Haller as mentioning
(“Elementa Physiologiae,” Tomus V., p. 190) many
instances of this kind; he also narrates how B. S. Albinus
(1697–1770), the greatest anatomist of the eighteenth century
and a colleague of Boerhaave at the University of Leyden,
was in the habit of removing his wig whenever he
wished to exhibit to the students how great was his control
over the movements of the auricle of the ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>In another place Hyrtl calls attention to the not uncommon
error of giving, to the structureless membrane which
Descemet described in 1758, the name of Membrana Descemetii.
According to him it was first described by the
Englishman E. Duddel, twenty-nine years earlier, in his
“Disease of the Horny Coat of the Eye,” London, 1729.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to his famous general treatise on anatomy, of
which, in the course of 38 years, no fewer than 17 editions
were printed, Hyrtl published in 1845 a memoir on the organ
of hearing, and in 1860 a “Manual for the Use of Dissectors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His death occurred in 1884.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>BAGLIVI, MORGAGNI, SCARPA, SPALLANZANI,
TISSOT AND GALVANI; ITALY’S MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
PHYSICIANS DURING THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Giorgio Baglivi</span>, the most distinguished Italian physician
of the seventeenth century (1669–1707), was probably the
first medical author in that country to lay stress upon the
importance of studying disease through direct observation
rather than from books. In his treatise on the practice of
medicine, which was first published in Latin at Rome in 1696
and afterward translated into several modern languages
(London, 1704; Paris, 1757), he makes the following
remarks:—</p>

<p class='c017'>There are several obstacles which have hitherto stood in the way
of a more general adoption of the maxim that direct observation
constitutes the best method of studying disease. They are the following:
the widespread contempt for the authority of the physicians
of antiquity; the false opinions and prejudices to which men became
attached as if they were idols; the habit of making erroneous comparisons
and of drawing hasty conclusions, as well as the formulating
of analogies that are based upon untrustworthy reports; reading
books which have been unwisely chosen or reading without exercising
a discerning judgment; incorrect interpretation of the author’s
meaning; the craze for reducing everything to a system; and the
abandonment, by authors, of the habit of expressing their thoughts
in the form of maxims.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Giovanni Battista Morgagni</span>, one of the greatest anatomists
of the eighteenth century and the prince of anatomo-pathologists,
was born on February 25, 1682, at Forli, an
Italian town situated about forty miles southeast of
Bologna. The death of his father when the boy was only
seven years old made it necessary for his mother to assume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>entire control of his early education. She performed this
duty so faithfully and with such excellent judgment that, by
the time Giovanni had attained his fourteenth year, he was
so thoroughly familiar with the literature of Italy, and also
of European countries generally, that the Academy of
Forli unhesitatingly accepted him as a member of that
organization. Two years later Giovanni went to Bologna
and began the study of medicine under the guidance of such
distinguished teachers as Hyppolyte Albertini and Antonius
Valsalva; and three years later (in 1701) he was given
the degree of Doctor of Medicine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morgagni’s biographers say little or nothing about his
personal traits of character and about the manner in which
he spent the larger part of his time during the early years
of his professional career. His published writings, however,
make it perfectly clear that almost from the very first
his chief interest was centred in the study of anatomy as
revealed to him by dissections of the dead human body; and,
as the years rolled past, he evidently grew more and more
strongly interested in the changes which take place in the
organs and tissues of the body as the result of accidental
injuries and of disease. From these same writings one
learns further that he was in the habit of writing down,
with the most painstaking minuteness, all the various departures
from the normal standard as fast as they revealed
themselves to his critical vision. He left no opportunity
for the occurrence of errors due to a defect in his memory.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1706 he published a treatise bearing the title “Adversaria
Anatomica.” It was this work which first laid the
foundation of his reputation. In 1716 he was given the
Chair of Anatomy at the University of Padua, and he
continued to hold this position up to the time of his death
in 1771.</p>

<p class='c007'>Relatively late in life—that is, in 1767—he published his
treatise “De Sedibus et Causis Morborum” (on the seats
and causes of different diseases). This work, says Rokitansky,
stands for all time, notwithstanding its defects, as
a monument in honor of its author, by reason of the great
industry and perseverance which it displays, and because of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>its wealth of detail, orderliness of arrangement, acuteness
of reasoning, and excellence in the choice of methods,—in
short, because of its originality. Théophile Bonnet’s great
work on the same subject (“Sepulchretum”) was published
in 1700, but, like its successor, its usefulness to-day
is limited, at least in large measure, to that of a huge
museum of pathological specimens. Rokitansky, of Vienna,
was in reality the first anatomist who appreciated at its
full value the fact that these lifeless specimens furnish most
useful lessons in the theory and practice of medicine.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lazarus Spallanzani</span> was born in 1729 at Scandiano, a
small town in the northeastern corner of the Apennines,
about fourteen miles from Modena, Italy. At the age of
fifteen he began to study physics, mathematics and philosophy
at the University of Bologna, under the guidance of
his relative, Laura Bassi, one of the most distinguished
members of the Faculty of the Bologna Institute of Science.
At the same time he cultivated a knowledge of Greek, Latin
and French, as well as of his native language. As his father
was anxious to have him do so, he also studied jurisprudence
for a certain length of time, but he abandoned this
study when his father, who had been persuaded by Antonio
Vallisnieri, Professor of Natural History at the University
of Padua, that the lad was much better fitted to follow the
career of a biologist than that of a jurist, gave his son full
permission to adopt whatever line of studies best suited his
tastes and inclination. Accordingly, from this time forward
Spallanzani devoted himself with increased zest to the study
of mathematics and the dead and living languages.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1754 the University of Reggio—a town which is only
a few miles distant from Scandiano—elected him to the
Chair of Logic, Mathematics and Greek; and this position
he continued to hold with credit to himself during the following
six years; and during this period he devoted all his
leisure hours to the observation of Nature. In this way he
was able to make a few discoveries concerning the animalcules
that are found in infusions; and it was not long before
these discoveries attracted the attention of those distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Swiss naturalists—von Haller, of Berne, and
Bonnet, of Geneva.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1760 Spallanzani was invited to occupy a chair in the
University of Modena, and he taught in that institution for
a period of eight years. During his term of office at this
institution he published two memoirs—one on the animal
nature of microscopic animalculi, and a second on the
changes effected in the shapes of stones by the action of
running water.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1767, the Empress Maria Theresa decided to render
the University of Pavia more effective as a scientific institute,
and with this purpose in view she established certain
new professorships, and among the number one on natural
history. As the first incumbent of this new chair she called
(in 1768) Spallanzani, who by this time had acquired a
great reputation in the scientific world as a biologist. His
extensive knowledge in a variety of departments was associated
with a remarkable genius; his methods were simple
and easily understood, and—to speak figuratively—he took
his auditors by the hand and led them to a clear understanding
of the truth, or to the point where they could
appreciate that the truth was not far distant and was certainly
attainable in the near future. He possessed the art
of interpreting Nature by her own methods, and by this art
he was able to render wonderfully clear all the subjects with
which he dealt in his lectures. All those who heard him
speak gave him credit for being at times positively eloquent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lack of space will not permit me to furnish more than a
few details of the original investigations which he made at
this period of his career. Although at first glance it may
be thought that Spallanzani’s work had very little to do
with the science of medicine, on closer examination it will
be seen that a study of the vital processes in the lower forms
of life (which was Spallanzani’s chief occupation) are
largely the same as those which characterize the higher
forms, and therefore—since great difficulties attend the
study of the same processes in man—it is of the very
greatest importance that the search for light on this subject
should be conducted on the lower organisms, even on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the minute organisms which are found in stagnant water.
Spallanzani was therefore engaged, in a very direct manner,
in laying the foundations of the true science of medicine.
Von Haller, the great Swiss pioneer in biology, was fully
aware of this fact when he dedicated the fourth volume of
his “Elementa Physiologiae”</p>
<p class='c023'>To that most illustrious man, Lazarus Spallanzani, to whom
credit is due for the fact that, although he had already explored the
most minute and inaccessible of Nature’s pathways, he still sought
to learn whether the existing limits of our knowledge of the truth
might not be extended.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>In 1780, during his residence at Pavia, Spallanzani published
two new volumes containing memoirs on vegetable
and animal physiology. In one of these he discusses with
great thoroughness the subject of digestion, and describes
the difficult experiments which he made, largely upon birds,
in order to ascertain the nature of this process. In this
manner he ascertained that, in a very large number of
animals (insects excepted), digestion is effected by a juice
or fluid which dissolves the alimentary substances that have
been introduced into the stomach. “One is filled with admiration,”—says
his biographer and friend, Jean Senebier,
of Geneva, Switzerland,—“as one peruses Spallanzani’s
account of this series of experiments, and notices with what
scrupulous care he formulates the conclusions which he
draws from them with regard to the causes of the phenomena
observed.” And yet, in 1786, John Hunter, the distinguished
English anatomist and biologist, published a
memoir (“Observations on Certain Points of the Animal
Economy”) in which he dissents—somewhat sharply, says
Senebier—from these conclusions. In 1788 Spallanzani
published his reply to the observations made by Hunter
and in this he points out, “with a logic so clear and convincing
that it permits of no reply,” the errors of the English
physiologist’s criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>In several other published memoirs Spallanzani deals
with the problems of generation, the circulation of the
blood, the respiration, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this very brief and imperfect sketch of one of the
greatest biologists of the eighteenth century, I will simply
add the statement: His death occurred, after a brief illness,
February 11, 1799. In the parish church of Scandiano
there has been erected a magnificent mausoleum in honor
of Spallanzani.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Antonio Scarpa</span> (1747–1832), a native of Motta near
Treviso, Northern Italy, received his medical education at
the University of Padua. He was particularly devoted to
the study of anatomy, and, already in the second year of
the course, he had made such progress that he was allowed
to act as one of the prosectors. Morgagni, who was his
teacher, became very much attached to him and did everything
in his power to advance Scarpa’s interests. While
he was still in the student stage of his career Scarpa went
to Bologna and devoted himself for a few months to the
cultivation of surgery. On his return to Padua he passed
successfully the required examinations and was given the
degree of Doctor of Medicine. Not long afterward he was
called to fill the Chair of Anatomy and Surgery at the Medical
School of Modena. After eight years of service in that
institution he resigned and then visited France and England
for the purpose of gaining further knowledge in those
branches of medicine in which he was specially interested.
In 1783 he accepted a call from the University of Pavia to
occupy the Chair of Anatomy, and remained undisturbed
in this position for twelve years. In the year 1796, however,
at the time when Pavia became a part of the newly founded
Cisalpine Republic, Scarpa was asked to take the oath of
allegiance to the new government, an oath which was required
of all the functionaries of the university. Not
being willing to do this he was obliged to resign his professorship.
In 1805, Napoleon, after being crowned King
of Italy at Milan, passed through Pavia on his way back to
Paris. On this occasion he asked to have the university
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>professors presented to him, and, failing to find Scarpa
among those who attended the reception, he asked what had
become of him, for his great reputation as an anatomist
was well known to him. Then he learned how Scarpa had
been compelled, by reason of his unwillingness to sign the
oath, to resign his position in the university. “Well,”
replied Napoleon, “what if he did refuse to take the oath,
and what have political opinions to do with teaching anatomy?
Scarpa confers honor upon the University and upon
the country which I now govern, and I wish that he be
restored to his former position.” He was accordingly
restored to his professorship and during the following
seven years—that is, up to 1812—Scarpa continued his work
of teaching anatomy and of conducting the surgical clinic.
During the later years of his life he was a great sufferer
from calculous nephritis and chronic disease of the urinary
bladder, and these diseases finally caused his death on
October 31, 1832.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dezeimeris, in his estimate of the part played by Scarpa
in advancing the science of medicine, lays particular stress
upon the following two things: first, he was very active and
persisted in his efforts to impress upon surgeons the importance
of considering a knowledge of anatomy as affording
the only safe and sure route to progress in the surgical
art; and, second, he furnished a number of beautiful
examples that showed the necessity of throwing additional
light upon the different diseases by the employment of
demonstrations in topographical and pathological anatomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>His more important published works are—aside from the
value of the text—<i>chefs-d’oeuvre</i> of iconography. Such,
for example, are the following: “De Structura Fenestrae
Rotundae Auris etc.,” Modena, 1772; “De Grangliis et
Plexubus Nervorum,” Modena, 1779; “Anatomicae Disquisitiones
de Auditu et Olfactu,” Pavia, 1789; and “Opuscoli
di Chirurgia,” Pavia, 1825–1832, 3 vols.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Samuel-Auguste-André-David Tissot (1728).</span> The Tissots
are of Italian origin. Alessandro Tissoni, the youngest
son of one of the first families of Spoleto, accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Prince Louis on his crusade to the Holy Land in 1147, and,
after escaping from the disasters incident to the siege of
Damascus, he managed to regain his native land along with
the forlorn remnants of Louis’ army. As he had joined the
expedition contrary to the wishes of his parents he felt that
it would not do for him to return to Spoleto. At first, therefore,
he was a homeless wanderer in his own country.
Fortunately for him, however, three of his companions in
arms bequeathed to him all their property just before they
died from their wounds; and consequently one of his first
cares, after he returned to Italy, was to gain possession of
his legacies. In the case of one of the three men there was
a sister living, and so—partly from love and partly in order
to escape any unpleasant legal complications—Alessandro
married her, and the couple took possession of the deceased
brother’s landed property. Some of this property, it so
happened, was located in Franche-Comté, near the present
city of Besançon, and it was while he resided in this part
of France (1152) that he changed his name to Tissot, thus
putting an end to the possibility that his relatives in Spoleto
would ever be able successfully to claim any part of his
property. Samuel-André’s father, Pierre Tissot, a land
surveyor who resided in Grancy, not far from Lausanne,
entered his son’s name (May 15, 1741) at the Academy of
Geneva, in the department of belles-lettres. In August,
1745, he received the degree of M.A., and on the fourteenth
of the following month of September he started on his journey
to Montpellier where he was to study medicine. Four
years later he passed all his examinations creditably and
was given the degree of M.D. He chose Lausanne as his
place of residence, and was successful, at the end of one
year, in obtaining the position of Physician of the Poor.
Early in 1745 he made the acquaintance of Albrecht von
Haller, the celebrated physiologist of Berne, and about the
same time he became deeply attached to Dr. Théodore
Tronchin, a native of Geneva, but engaged in active practice
at Paris. These two men were the most distinguished
Swiss Physicians of that period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eynard, Tissot’s biographer, says that up to the end of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>his life he preferred to carry on his epistolary correspondence
in Latin; and yet at the same time he was the author
of several medical treatises that were extremely popular.
One of them in particular (“L’Avis au Peuple”) passed
through many French editions,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and was translated, in the
course of the next twenty-five years, into all the leading
European languages. Strange as it may appear to us
moderns, this book was not written originally for the general
public, but only for the peasants of the Canton de
Vaud, who were constantly falling victims to charlatans and
itinerant quacks; and yet the universities of Goettingen and
Giessen recommended the work as proper reading matter
for their students. In order to show the high degree of
esteem in which Tissot was held by his fellow citizens of
Lausanne, the authorities conferred on him the rights and
privileges of citizenship “on account of his praiseworthy
efforts to improve the condition of its inhabitants”; and
as, in the course of time, the limits of the city were extended,
the name “<i>Avenue Dr. Tissot</i>” was bestowed on one of its
finest residence streets.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1765 Stanislas Augustus, King of Poland, invited Tissot
to accept the office of First Physician of his Majesty at
Warsaw. Although the invitation was couched in the most
friendly terms, Tissot was not willing to leave his beloved
Lausanne. All sorts of influences were brought into play
by the King to make him change his mind, but his resolution
remained fixed. In his reply to the letter Tissot said:—</p>

<p class='c017'>My first reason for declining your highly flattering offer is this:
I am very much attached to my father and mother and to my uncle,
who have brought me up from infancy with the tenderest care, and
who, owing to their advanced age, are likely at any time to need
my aid and advice, and who would be heartbroken if I were to go
far away from them. My second reason consists in the sentiment
that I am not in any way fitted to fill such a position with entire
satisfaction to all the interests concerned, for it involves many
important duties beside that of watching over your health—as, for
example, the superintendence of the different institutions in your
kingdom which are devoted to the preservation of the health of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>your subjects; the duty of reporting to you any evidences of mismanagement
that I may discover and the suggestion of such new
measures as are likely to remedy any such deficiencies; the promotion
of the efficiency of your schools of medicine, surgery, midwifery,
pharmacy, etc.; and, last of all, there is the important
consideration that my position here in Lausanne is in every respect
most satisfactory to me. Why, then, should I abandon these surroundings
in which my life is most happy, for a position in which
I might easily lose a large part of this happiness?</p>

<p class='c019'>Notwithstanding Tissot’s decided refusal to accept the
flattering offer made by King Stanislas, the latter did not
give up all hope of persuading him eventually to accept the
position of First Physician. Three times in succession, at
short intervals, he sent him a renewal of the invitation, each
time adding some fresh inducement in the hope of overcoming
Tissot’s objections; and, just as the latter had
nearly made up his mind to yield to the King’s urgent
request—the death of his much-beloved uncle a few days
previously having removed one of the strongest obstacles
in the way of his acceptance—the ruling authorities of the
Academy of Lausanne notified him that a Chair of Medicine
had been created by them and that he had been appointed
its first occupant. Stanislas then at last recognized that he
must definitely abandon his cherished project, and he accordingly
sent a fine portrait of himself to Tissot, with a
charming letter in which he said:—</p>

<p class='c017'>I am truly afflicted by your decision, but I take comfort in the
thought that probably my persistent efforts to bring you to Warsaw
had something to do with hastening the decision of the Berne
authorities to establish the Chair of Medicine at Lausanne for your
benefit. I congratulate you on your good fortune and your compatriots
on their having had the wisdom to appreciate the value of
your services to Switzerland. I pray God, Monsieur Tissot, that
He may have you in safe keeping.</p>
<div class='c024'><span class='sc'>Stanislas Augustus</span>, <span class='sc'>King</span></div>
<p class='c018'>Warsaw, March 5, 1765.</p>

<p class='c019'>Lausanne in 1765, it should here be stated, still recognized
the Bernese Government as its overlord. It was only at a
somewhat later date that it acquired entire independence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>In closing this brief account of Tissot’s correspondence
with the King of Poland, I ought to add that it was largely
through the intercession of Albrecht von Haller, the distinguished
physiologist and himself a citizen of the Swiss
metropolis, that the senators at Berne were induced to
found a Chair of Medicine at Lausanne for the express purpose
of preventing Tissot from leaving Switzerland. I also
should state that Tissot himself was entirely ignorant at
the time that von Haller had been instrumental in effecting
the establishment of this new professorship at Lausanne.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is an anecdote which is told by Lantier in his book
“Les Voyageurs en Suisse.” While it relates only indirectly
to Tissot it furnishes an amusing illustration of what may
easily happen in the experience of any physician who has
a large office practice:—</p>

<p class='c017'>A certain Adolphe D. called at Tissot’s residence and rang the
door bell. An elderly female servant, who opened the door, said
that her master, the doctor, was not at home. “But,” she added,
“if you have come to consult him about some malady, I warn you
that you will lose your money and have nothing to show for your
trouble. For the past twenty years I have had a pain in my
stomach, and the doctor has not been able to cure it.” Tissot, to
whom I related the incident, joined me in a hearty laugh over the
affair.</p>

<p class='c019'>In November, 1779, Tissot was urged to visit Paris in
company with his adopted son, who was studying medicine.
Believing that the young student would be greatly benefited
by such a visit to the French capital he at once decided to
undertake the trip. But, very soon after his arrival in
Paris, he discovered that he was to have no rest so long as
he remained there. His celebrity brought him almost at
once many people who wished to consult him about their
ailments. Often, says his biographer, the Rue des Petits
Augustins, where his temporary residence was located, was
filled with a long line of carriages belonging to the distinguished
patients who awaited their turn to interview the
great physician from Lausanne. This sort of medical practice
was not at all to his taste; and when he was not busy
with professional work he was attending an endless series
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of dinners and receptions. At the end of a few months he
returned to Lausanne, and would have been well pleased
to remain there permanently; but he soon recognized that,
in the interest of his adopted son, he should take up his
residence in some German or Italian city where there was a
university. Just at this juncture of affairs Borsieri, the
distinguished Professor of the Theory and Practice of
Medicine at the University of Pavia, Tuscany, a man well
advanced in years, sent in his resignation. Whereupon
Joseph II., Holy Roman Emperor and King of Austria,
immediately urged his brother Leopold II., Duke of Tuscany,
to offer the position to Dr. Tissot. The latter took the invitation
seriously under consideration and in due course of
time accepted. His honorarium was fixed at 3000 German
florins (about $1500 U. S. currency) and in addition he
was accorded various important privileges—such, for
example, as a suitably furnished residence; a ward equipped
with six beds and arranged in such a manner that clinical
instruction might be conveniently given in it; and the right
to carry on private practice in the district of Milan and also
outside the limits of that district whenever this could be
done without interfering with his duties at the university.
Further, he was permitted to resign his chair at the end of
two years if he should so desire. Finally, he was reimbursed
for all his traveling expenses, and was absolved from attendance
upon any functions or ceremonies that might conflict
with his conscientious scruples as a Protestant. For a
Government that was strictly under the control of the
Roman Catholic Church these terms were remarkably
liberal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tissot appears to have been very successful, both as a
teacher and in his social relations with the people whom he
met during his short stay of two years at Pavia. In a letter
which Spallanzani wrote on December 31, 1781, to Charles
Bonnet, the distinguished naturalist of Geneva, he speaks
of Tissot’s arrival at Pavia in the following terms:—</p>

<p class='c017'>He seems to be pleased with our university, with our colleagues,
and with our students. Everybody in Pavia likes him. His lectures
are most instructive and well adapted to the character of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>young men who have come hither from every part of Italy to profit
from the teaching of this Swiss Hippocrates. Apart from the
knowledge which he possesses, and which certainly is very extensive,
Monsieur Tissot is the most polished, the most amiable man I have
ever met.</p>

<p class='c019'>It would be a pleasure to furnish here a <i>résumé</i> of the
detailed account which Tissot’s biographer gives of his lectures
and of his most practical clinical instruction, but I
perceive that I have already drawn out my sketch to an
inordinate length, and I must therefore stop at this point.
I will simply add one more item of information. Early in
1783 Tissot publicly announced his intention of resigning
his professorship at the end of the period of service that had
originally been agreed upon—viz., two years; and on June
12 of the same year, at which date the academic year ended,
he delivered his farewell address to the students of the university.
To perpetuate the memory of this occasion those
students who were permanent residents of Pavia set up in
one of the lecture rooms a suitably inscribed marble tablet;
those who came from other parts of Europe (72 in all) prepared
their memorial in the form of a small printed volume
(104 pages) of sonnets written in Latin, Greek, Italian, German,
French and English, and grouped together under the
title:—</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Sentimenti d’Affetto e di Riconoscenza Degli Studenti di medicina
Verso il Loro Immortale Precettore, il Signor S. A. D. Tissot.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>On the 21st of June, 1783, in company with his nephew,
Tissot left Pavia for Switzerland by way of the Simplon
Pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already in 1794 his health began to show unmistakable
signs of breaking down under the influence of a progressive
pulmonary tuberculosis, and it was not long afterward that
his death occurred (June 13, 1797) at his residence in
Lausanne.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Aloysius Galvani</span>, born at Bologna, Italy, on September
9, 1759, and appointed public lecturer in anatomy at the university
in 1762, published in 1791 a treatise in which he
announced his discovery of a new force to which he gave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>name of animal electricity, but which subsequently received
that of “galvanism” in honor of its discoverer,—a name
which it has retained ever since. By a mere accident Galvani
discovered the fact that when two different metals—iron
and copper, for example—are brought in contact with
muscular tissue there results from this contact a force,
seemingly an electric current, which causes the muscle to
contract. Six years later—that is, in 1797—the Cisalpine
Republic was formed by the joining together of what were
known as the Cispadane and the Transpadane Republics—two
political organizations that occupied respectively, as
their names imply, territories situated the one on the north
side and the other on the south side of the river Po, and
both of which organizations owed their existence to the
action of Napoleon Bonaparte. When the professors of the
University of Bologna, which was located in the Transpadane
territory, were called upon to swear allegiance to the
new republic, Galvani was the only member of the Faculty
who refused to take the oath, and as a consequence he lost
his professorship. His death occurred in 1798.</p>

    <div>MEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE CONTROL OF SMALL-POX</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c004'>I. <span class='sc'>Inoculation</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>About the year 922 of the present era the Arabian physician
Rhazes wrote and published (in MS.) the earliest
known report of the malady now called Variola or Small-Pox.
From this fact the inference should not be drawn that
the disease first came into existence in the time of Rhazes,
for it can scarcely be doubted that it had already existed in
the East for ages before the period mentioned. Since the
thirteenth century it has appeared repeatedly in epidemic
form in widely separated countries, causing, especially
among the eastern nations, a fearful mortality. Sydenham,
the great English physician, succeeded during the seventeenth
century in devising a method of treatment that in
some degree diminished the mortality of this affection, at
least in Great Britain. It was, however, in no sense a preventive
procedure, and the spread of small-pox continued
unchecked until Jenner, in 1796, introduced vaccination;
and even then the efficiency of this method was not promptly
acknowledged by the Medical Profession; indeed, several
years had to elapse before even the best London physicians,
the men who possessed the most complete facilities for
ascertaining the whole truth with regard to Jenner and his
new method, became convinced that a great and most efficacious
protection against small-pox had at last been found.
In the meantime—that is, for almost half a century—the
procedure known as “inoculation” was accepted by the
upper classes of the community in all parts of Europe as
affording the maximum amount of protection attainable
against the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>There were in Europe, during the last half of the eighteenth
century, two physicians—<span class='sc'>Baron Thomas Dimsdale</span>,
an Englishman, and <span class='sc'>Dr. Théodore Tronchin</span>, of Geneva
and Paris—who obtained considerable celebrity as inoculators.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first-named, <span class='sc'>Baron Thomas Dimsdale</span>, was born in
1712 and began to practice his profession in 1734 at Hertford,
twenty-four miles north of London. Already as early
as in 1741 he had acquired so great a reputation for his
success, both in performing the operation and in carrying
the patient safely through the resulting infection,—that is,
through the attack of small-pox thus artificially produced,—that
he was sent for to inoculate first the Czarina of Russia,
then the Grand Duke Paul, and subsequently the children
of many of the first families of the Russian Empire.
Shortly after his return to England he was made a member
of the Royal Society, and at a still later date the city of
Hertford chose him as their representative in the House of
Commons. In 1781, on the occasion of his second visit to
Russia, he inoculated the Czar Alexander and the Grand
Duke Constantine. His death occurred on December 30,
1800.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among Dimsdale’s published works relating to small-pox
and inoculation the following deserve to receive special mention:
“The Present Method of Inoculating for the Small-Pox”,
London, 1766, 1767 and 1772; “Thoughts on General
and Partial Inoculation,” London, 1776; and “Account of
a Voyage to Russia and Report of the Procedure Carried
out in the Cases of Catherine and Paul.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Baron Dimsdale, it seems scarcely necessary to add, was
not the inventor of the practice of inoculation but simply
the individual who revived and made popular, first in
England and afterward on the continent of Europe (more
particularly in Russia), a practice which long before had
been employed in China.</p>

<p>Medal commemorating the discovery of vaccination. From Eugen Hollaender’s “<i>Medizin und Plastik</i>,” by permission.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Théodore Tronchin</span>, the second inoculator mentioned
above, was a native of Geneva, Switzerland,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> and was highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>esteemed in France as a practitioner of medicine during the
period that is now under consideration (1750–1785). Furthermore,
it was widely known that he was the family
physician of Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, as well as the
medical adviser and intimate friend of Voltaire, both of
which facts undoubtedly aided him in gaining popularity
among the members of the fashionable set of Paris. It is
therefore easy to understand why, when he espoused the
cause of inoculation, he should have so rapidly attained
celebrity as a successful inoculator, not only in Paris but
also throughout Europe. On the other hand, it is not at all
clear why the inoculation method should have been looked
upon with any favor by the educated classes, for it soon
became increasingly evident that the operation was attended
with considerable risk through the danger of introducing
other infective agents into the system; and, in addition, no
satisfactory evidence was forthcoming that these inoculations
possessed the slightest degree of genuine protective
power. To-day we are unable to discover in this procedure
any other advantages than the following:—The patient is
thereby enabled to select the time when, and the surroundings
in which, he or she will submit to an attack of small-pox;
for, it must be remembered, no well-grounded hope was
held out by the inoculators of the eighteenth century that
the artificially produced disease would prove less fatal than
that which is acquired accidentally. And yet some such
hope was apparently cherished by the people of that period,
for Benjamin Franklin, writing in 1788, makes the following
remark in relation to this very question:—</p>

<p class='c017'>In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the
small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and
still regret, that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I
mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the
supposition that they never should forgive themselves if a child
died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the
same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.</p>

<p class='c019'>These bitter regrets expressed by Franklin show plainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>that he, like others of his time, had strong confidence in the
efficiency of inoculation.</p>
<h3 class='c004'>II. <span class='sc'>Vaccination</span></h3>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Edward Jenner</span>, the discoverer of vaccination as an effective
means of protection against small-pox, was born at
Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England, on May 17, 1749. After
the death of his parents while he was still a mere child,
Edward passed under the guardianship of his eldest brother,
the Rev. Stephen Jenner, and was brought up by him with
affectionate care and judicious guidance. At a very early
age he showed a decided taste for natural history; and after
leaving school he began to receive instruction in the elements
of surgery and pharmacy from a Mr. Ludlow, an
eminent surgeon of Sodbury, near Bristol. As the next
step in his education he spent two years under the direction
of the celebrated experimental pathologist, John Hunter,
of London, in whose family he resided for two years. He
was about twenty-one years of age when he went to London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already at this early period he showed unmistakable evidences
of being a close observer, scrupulous and accurate
in his examination of the objects of his studies. He was also
gifted with much enterprise and perseverance, characteristics
which greatly aided him in mastering difficulties that
would have seriously obstructed the progress of an individual
possessing an inferior mind. Mr. Hunter, who was
at this time in the prime of life, completely won the affection
and respect of his pupil, who particularly admired the boldness
and independence of his teacher’s character. Jenner
was peculiarly alive to virtues of this kind. After completing
his professional studies in London he retired from
Hunter’s house, but the intimate relations which had been
established between these two men persisted up to the time
of the latter’s death in October, 1793.</p>

<p>EDWARD JENNER<br /><br />(Copied from Thomas J. Pettigrew’s “Medical Portrait Gallery,” London, 1838. The original portrait was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, Royal Academy.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after his return from London Jenner took
up his residence with his brother Stephen, at Berkeley, and
began his career as a practitioner of medicine. At the same
time, as opportunity afforded, he continued to pursue his
favorite studies in natural history. Thus, in a comparatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>short period of time, he accumulated a series of specimens
illustrative of comparative anatomy, and sufficiently
numerous to form a museum of no inconsiderable
magnitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>In describing the manner in which Jenner’s attention was
first seriously directed to the subject of cow-pox Dr. Baron,
his biographer, uses the following language:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Jenner was pursuing his professional education in the house of
his master at Sodbury; a young country-woman came to seek
advice; the subject of small-pox was mentioned in her presence;
she immediately observed, “I cannot take that disease, for I have
had cow-pox.” This incident riveted the attention of Jenner. It
was the first time that the popular notion, which was not at all
uncommon in the district, had been brought home to him with force
and influence. Most happily the impression which was then made
was never effaced. Young as he was, and insufficiently acquainted
with any of the laws of physiology or pathology, he dwelt with
deep interest on the communication which had been casually made
known to him by a peasant, and partly foresaw the vast consequences
which were involved in so remarkable a phenomenon. He
was the more stimulated to meditations of this sort by frequent
opportunities of witnessing the ravages of small-pox; and by retaining
the most vivid and painful recollections of the severe
discipline which he himself had not long before passed through,
preparatory to his inoculation for that disease. “There was”—to
use his own words—“bleeding till the blood was thin; purging till
the body was wasted to a skeleton; and starving on vegetable diet
to keep it so.” The possibility of averting such evils could not
arise in a mind like Jenner’s without possessing it fully; and he
resolved to let no opportunity escape of acquiring knowledge on so
important a subject.... It was not till some years after his return
from London that he had an opportunity of examining into the
truth of the traditions respecting cow-pox. This was about the
year 1775, a date which corresponds with the period specified by
him in his tract on “The Origin of Vaccine Inoculation.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Although during the following five years Jenner’s efforts
to learn the full truth about cow-pox brought him very little
nearer the goal which he was aiming to reach, he nevertheless
pursued with zeal and vigor his studies concerning
the nature of this disease and concerning its relations to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>small-pox. Among the facts which he ascertained during
this period the following deserve to receive mention here:
(1) There are several different diseases to which milkers
are liable when they handle infected cows; but (2) only one
of them possesses the power of furnishing protection
against small-pox. The discovery of these facts made it
easy to understand why vaccination with the virus of what
was commonly called cow-pox not infrequently failed to
protect the individual so vaccinated from genuine small-pox.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of still further investigations Jenner felt
warranted in drawing the conclusion that small-pox, cow-pox
and swine-pox had a common origin,—in fact, were
varieties of the same disease. Dr. Baron mentions the following
incidents or experiences as affording a strong
corroboration of the truth of the statements just made:—</p>

<p class='c017'>In November, 1789, Jenner inoculated his eldest son Edward,
who was then about one year and a half old, with swine-pox matter.
The progress of the disease seemed similar to that which arises from
the insertion of true small-pox matter when the disease is very
slight. He sickened on the eighth day; a few pustules appeared;
they were late and were slow in their progress and small. Subsequently,
at five or six different periods, variolous matter was carefully
inserted into his arms without the slightest inflammation
being excited in the part.</p>

<p class='c018'>On April 7, 1791, variolous matter was again inserted by two
small incisions through the cutis.</p>

<p class='c018'>April 9, parts evidently inflamed.</p>

<p class='c018'>April 10, an efflorescence of the size of a shilling spread around
the inferior wound.</p>

<p class='c018'>April 11, the incision assumed a kind of erysipelatous elevation;
the efflorescence much increased.</p>

<p class='c018'>April 12, still further increase in the efflorescence; a vesicle about
the size of a large split pea, and containing a brownish clear fluid,
had also formed close to the superior incision; and a still larger one
was visible near the edge of the inferior incision. The erysipelas
extended to the shoulder and then quickly subsided. The child
showed no signs of indisposition the whole time.</p>

<p class='c018'>In March, 1792, a fresh inoculation was made. A well-marked
inflammatory reaction followed.</p>

<p class='c018'>At a later date Jenner learned that there were well-authenticated
instances to prove that when the true cow-pox broke out among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>cattle at a dairy and was communicated to the milkers, even they
had subsequently contracted small-pox. The discovery of this fact
perplexed him greatly. Indeed, in the case of most men the discovery
would probably have led to the abandonment of all further
experimentation. But Jenner did not allow himself to be discouraged.
It occurred to him that the virus of the cow-pox itself
might have undergone some change whereby its specific virtues
were lost; that, in this deteriorated state, it might have been capable
of producing only a local disease upon the hand, but no such influence
upon the constitution as is requisite to render the individual
unsusceptible of contracting small-pox. In other words, he believed
it possible that the same cow might one day communicate a genuine
and efficacious preventive, and, the next, nothing but a local affection
that would exert no beneficial influence whatever on the constitution.
This most ingenious and forcible reasoning, supported
by analogies drawn from the well-known properties of the virus of
small-pox itself, received an ample confirmation from experience,
and was the basis on which some of the fundamental rules for the
practice of vaccination were founded. It was ascertained that it
was only in a certain state of the pustule that virus was afforded
capable of imparting to the constitution its protecting power; that
matter taken after this period might excite a local disease, but not
of such a sort as to render the individual proof against the effects
of variolous contagion.</p>

<p class='c019'>In 1796 Jenner had an opportunity to carry his investigations
a step further.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hitherto,” says his biographer, “he had only observed the
casual disease and investigated its laws; it yet remained to be proved
whether it was possible to propagate the affection by artificial
inoculation from one human being to another, and thereby, at will,
communicate security to all who were liable to small-pox. An
opportunity occurred, on the fourteenth of May, 1796, of instituting
this experiment. Matter was taken from the hand of Sarah Nelmes
who had been infected by her master’s cows, and inserted by two
superficial incisions into the arms of James Phipps, a healthy boy
eight years old. He went through the disease apparently in a
regular and satisfactory manner; but the most agitating part of
the trial still remained to be performed. It was needful to ascertain
whether he was secure from the contagion of small-pox. This
point, so full of anxiety to Dr. Jenner, was fairly put to issue on
the first of the following July. Variolous matter, immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>taken from a pustule, was carefully inserted by several incisions,
but no disease followed.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Shortly afterward Jenner wrote to his friend Gardner:—</p>

<p class='c017'>You will be gratified in hearing that I have at length accomplished
what I have been so long waiting for, viz., the passing of
the vaccine virus (the virus of cow-pox) from one human being to
another by the ordinary mode of inoculation.... I was astonished
at the close resemblance of the pustules, in some of their stages, to
the variolous pustules. But now listen to the most delightful part
of my story. The boy has since been inoculated for the small-pox,
which, as I ventured to predict, produced no effect. I shall now
pursue my experiments with redoubled ardor.</p>

<p class='c019'>My readers can easily imagine with what deep anxiety
mingled with an intense desire for a completely successful
result, Jenner, from this time forward, prosecuted his
labors. Unfortunately, he was not able, owing to the disappearance
of cow-pox from the dairies of the region in which
he lived, to resume his experimental work before the spring
of 1798. He was also not willing to make a public announcement
of the important results which he had obtained until
he should have amply confirmed their accuracy by further
experimentation. It was therefore not until during the
early part of the summer of 1798 that he issued a printed
pamphlet of a little more than seventy pages, in the quarto
form, and bearing the title “An Inquiry into the Causes
and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On April 24, 1798, about two months before the publication
of his pamphlet, Jenner repaired to London for the
purposes of exhibiting the cow-pox and of demonstrating to
his professional friends the truth of his assertions. Although
he remained in the metropolis nearly three months
he was unable to procure a single person on whom he could
exhibit the vaccine disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the cow-pox virus which Jenner carried with him
was consigned to Mr. Cline, a London physician, who,
toward the end of July, inserted it by two punctures into
the hip of a child. A few days later he reported that “the
cow-pox experiment had succeeded admirably.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As happens in practically every important discovery in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>therapeutics, there arose soon in many quarters serious
doubts as to the prophylactic powers of the method advocated
by Jenner. Some men even went so far as to question
the accuracy of his statements and to impugn his authority
to advocate the practice of vaccination. On the other hand,
there were many, and they too of the most learned and
respectable, who immediately did justice to the merits of
Jenner, and who cordially acknowledged the many important
consequences which were involved in the subject that
he had so ably and so modestly brought before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a letter which Jenner wrote to one of his friends
only a few weeks after he had published the “Inquiry” it
appears that already at that early date he foresaw the
probability that there would occur, in the further evolution
of vaccination as a prophylactic measure, those very complications
which, from that time to the present, have
interfered so seriously with the universal acceptance of this
procedure as a measure of vast beneficence to the human
race. These so-called complications were, in the great majority
of instances, manifestations of septic infection,
brought about by carelessness in the handling of the inoculation
wound; but this fact was not at all appreciated in
Jenner’s time. During the years immediately following
that in which the discovery of the new procedure was announced
to the physicians of England vaccination made
fairly rapid progress in public favor. Already as early as
in June, 1800, Jenner, while on a visit to Oxford, was there
presented, by the leading physicians of that city, with a
testimonial in which it was declared that cow-pox is an
effectual prophylactic agent against the small-pox. Two
years later the English Parliament voted Jenner a grant of
£10,000 as a reward for the very valuable discovery which
he had made and for his prolonged labors in rendering the
procedure of great utility to the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>Strange as it may appear to those who are not familiar
with the lives of the most meritorious and most unselfish
physicians of bygone centuries this bestowal of £10,000 by
Parliament upon Jenner did not add materially to his comfort;
in the long run it rather detracted from it. Some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>his friends, shortly after he had received the Parliamentary
grant of money, induced him to give up his country practice
and establish himself in the fashionable part of London;
they maintained that his widespread reputation as the discoverer
of vaccination and as the physician most capable of
conducting this operation in the safest and most effective
manner, would speedily bring him a large increase in
private practice. Such, however, did not prove to be the
case; and Jenner—who, unfortunately, had been overpersuaded
to follow this advice,—after the lapse of three or
four years, and appreciating the fact that his income was
not large enough for such a style of living, removed his
residence, first to Cheltenham and not long afterward to
Berkeley. He died of cerebral apoplexy in the spring of
1823.</p>

<p class='c014'>THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH CHEMISTS CONTRIBUTE
THEIR SHARE TOWARD THE ADVANCE
OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p class='c005'>During the latter part of the eighteenth century the chemists
of England and France manifested a new and decidedly
stronger interest in their branch of natural science; indeed,
they seemed to have suddenly appreciated the fact that
observation and experience afforded the only route by which
they might secure a genuine and useful increase of their
stock of knowledge. In the departments of physiology and
pathology, for example,—not to mention also that of therapeutics,—there
were at that period many questions which
still remained unsettled and which could not be satisfactorily
answered until a further advance had been made in
the existing knowledge of chemistry. Hence the great
importance of the movement to which I have just referred.
To cite only one of these unsettled questions I will mention
here that relating to the nature of the change which occurs
in the blood when it loses its venous hue after passing
through the lungs, and also, <i>vice versa</i>, when it loses its
arterial color after passing through the tissues in other
parts of the body. Harvey’s discovery had gone no further
than to reveal the pathway of the blood in its winding
course throughout the body, but now physiology demanded
an explanation of the changes which this fluid undergoes in
its travels along that pathway. The answer to this last
question, as will now be shown, was not gained through the
efforts of a single individual but by the researches that were
made by several very able English and French scientists,
more particularly by Joseph Priestley, the English chemist,
and by Lavoisier, the French biologist and chemist. During
the preceding fifty or sixty years the physicians of Europe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>had been obliged, for want of a more satisfactory explanation,
to accept Stahl’s phlogiston theory (that all combustible
materials contain an element to which he applied the
name of “phlogiston”), at least as a basis or starting-point
for the desired explanation.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Joseph Priestley</span>, who was born at Fieldhead, near Leeds,
England, in 1733, received his early education at a Dissenting
school; and in 1755 he became a Dissenting minister at
Needham Market. So far as the available evidence affords
any clear indication of Priestley’s bent of character the
inference is permissible that he was first and chiefly a
scientist, but yet possessing a profoundly religious type of
mind which the influences surrounding his boyhood doubtless
helped to intensify. Thus, during his ministerial work
he managed to devote a large part of his time to original
investigations in the domain of chemistry; and, as early
as in the year 1774, he succeeded in obtaining a gaseous
product to which he gave the name of “dephlogisticated
air.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> A detailed description of this discovery of oxygen—the
name which was given to the new gas at a later date—will
be found in Vol. 2 of the second edition of Priestley’s
“Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of
Air,” London, 1784. Broadly speaking, Priestley obtained
the new product by heating the red oxide of mercury. Subsequently
he discovered that respiration took place more
easily, and that combustion progressed more actively, in
the presence of this gas. But it is to the French chemist
Lavoisier that we owe the knowledge of the full significance
of oxygen. On the other hand, it was the English chemist
Cavendish who confirmed Priestley’s discovery that atmospheric
air is composed of water and different acids. Lavoisier,
it is claimed, discovered that all the acids which he
examined contain oxygen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking, at a later date, of his attempt to produce a
work on the chemistry of the air, Priestley says: “I find it
absolutely impossible to produce such a work that shall be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>anything like complete. My first publication I acknowledged
to be very imperfect, and the present, I am as ready to
acknowledge, is still more so. But, paradoxical as it may
seem, this will ever be the case in the progress of natural
science, so long as the works of God are, like himself, infinite
and inexhaustible. In completing one discovery we never
fail to get an imperfect knowledge of others, of which we
could have no idea before; so that we cannot solve one doubt
without creating several new ones. Travelling on this
ground resembles Pope’s description of travelling among
the Alps, with this difference, that here there is not only a
<i>succession</i>, but an <i>increase</i> of new objects and new difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is the description to which Priestley refers:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So, pleas’d at first the tow’ring Alps we try,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mount o’er the vales, and seem to tread the sky.</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ eternal snows appear already past,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the first clouds and mountains seem the last,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, those attained, we tremble to survey</div>
      <div class='line'>The growing labours of the lengthen’d way.</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ increasing prospect tires our wand’ring eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hills peep o’er hills, and Alps on Alps arise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On the 14th of July, 1791, there occurred a serious riot at
Birmingham, where Priestley was at that time settled as a
Dissenting minister. On that day a banquet was being given
in honor of the French Revolution, those who organized this
feast being in large measure Episcopalians. There were
numerous fraudulent cards of invitation which, rumor said,
were issued by Priestley. On the occasion itself numerous
toasts were offered in which sentiments antagonistic to
those generally entertained by the originators of the feast,
were expressed. As the festival progressed the crowd
became more and more excited and everybody seemed to be
imbued with the idea that in some way or other Priestley
was mixed up in the matter. The truth was, however, he
had nothing whatever to do with it, was not present at the
banquet, and even did not know that such a feast was being
given. Nevertheless, the crowd would not listen to reason,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and insisted that Priestley was the cause of the whole
trouble. Accordingly they secured lighted torches and
hastened to Priestley’s house which was located about half
a mile from the city limits, and proceeded to set it on fire.
Thus were destroyed, in the course of a few minutes, all his
books, all his valuable scientific apparatus, all the registers
of experiments covering a period of eleven years of unremitting
toil. Priestley, who was then nearly seventy years
old, lost practically everything that he possessed. For three
days the rioting continued, many of the houses of Priestley’s
friends being also destroyed by fire. Even the daily newspapers
asserted that among Priestley’s papers were found
evidences showing that a great conspiracy existed,—but for
what evil purpose it was not stated. Insults of all sorts
were heaped upon the innocent man, until finally he was
compelled, by the situation of affairs in Birmingham, to
leave the country. Fortunately for him, Priestley’s brother-in-law
left him in his will the sum of £10,000 and also an
annuity of £200. Thus provided for, Priestley left England
in 1794 and settled in Pennsylvania. His death occurred in
1804.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Antoine Laurent Lavoisier</span> was born in 1743 at Paris,
and at an early age displayed a fondness for serious scientific
studies. In 1768, although he had attained only his
twenty-fifth year, he was chosen a member of the French
Academy of the Sciences; and a very short time afterward
he received the appointment of <i>Fermier Général</i> (Government
Collector of Taxes), an appointment which showed
how highly he was esteemed for his ability as well as for his
integrity. At first, Lavoisier, like nearly all his contemporaries,
accepted Stahl’s phlogiston doctrine and his
views with regard to animism (see pp. 432 and 433 of my
work entitled: “The Growth of Medicine”); but gradually
he entertained more and more serious doubts with regard
to their correctness, and finally he came out boldly as an
opponent of these doctrines. The experiments which he
himself made, as well as those which were carried out by
other scientists of the same period, forced him to conclude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>that, in all chemical processes, no such thing as an actual
creation of something new takes place, nor is anything ever
lost. This truth, he claimed, applies as well to living beings
as to inanimate objects. In the middle of the eighteenth
century the treatises on chemistry did not acknowledge this
teaching as true. Vauquelin, for example, pointed to what
he believed to be a fact, viz., that animals actually produce
lime, inasmuch as hens—so he claimed—produce more lime
than they ingest with their food. Lavoisier’s remarkable
experiments showed that Stahl’s doctrine of animism, as
well as the phlogiston theory, was untenable. Stahl maintained,
for example, that there exists in all combustible
bodies a special element which is set free during the combustion
of such bodies, and to this element—as I have
already stated on a previous page—he gave the name of
“phlogiston.” Lavoisier, on the other hand, made it clear
that combustion represents simply the combination of the
two elements, carbon and oxygen; and at the same time he
showed that the act of respiration in animals is a species
of combustion, in the course of which oxygen combines with
certain elements of the body to form water and carbonic
acid. He did not, however, rest satisfied with these results,
but—aided by Seguin—pushed his experiments to the point
where he demonstrated the quantities of gas expired both
by man and by animals; thus greatly increasing our
knowledge of the phenomena of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Furthermore, Lavoisier was also the discoverer of a
method of analysis (still employed to-day) by means of
which it is possible to demonstrate the important fact that
all organic bodies are composed of carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen, sometimes in association with azote (lifeless matter).
In a word, he brought physiological chemistry to such
a stage of perfection that his successors have been able only
to make additions to the facts which he discovered, but not
to alter them in any essential respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lavoisier’s mind seemed always preoccupied with questions
relating to the grandeur and progress of humanity in
its entirety. Here is a single example of the truth of this
statement:—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>When he learned from his own observations that the exhalation
of carbonic acid increased during physical work, he drew the conclusion
that men who are obliged to perform severe labor stand in
need of a more abundant nourishment than is required by ordinary
workmen in order to recover the carbon which had been expended
in their severe labors; and he immediately urged that an effort be
made to furnish the working class with better nourishment. The
public functionary—he wrote at the end of his treatise on respiration
(published in 1789)—is not the only individual who works
for his country. The man of science, he added, is also fulfilling
his patriotic duty when he teaches, by his investigations, how
the misery which exists in the world may be alleviated. And if
he accomplishes nothing more than to add a few years, or even
only a few days, to the average duration of the life of man, he
still may with justice claim the right to be given the glorious
title of “benefactor of humanity.” (J. Rosenthal.)</p>

<p class='c019'>France, at the time when Lavoisier wrote his treatise on
respiration, was in the throes of a great revolution, out of
which came the Republic. But this republic showed no gratitude
to Lavoisier for the services which he had rendered to
his country; for, on the 8th of May, 1794, it executed him
without any specific charge having been brought against
him, simply because he had held the hated office of Government
Collector of Taxes. When one of Lavoisier’s personal
friends, just before the prisoner was removed to the guillotine,
called the judge’s attention to his scientific merits, this
functionary replied: “We no longer have any use for men of
science.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before closing this necessarily brief and somewhat superficial
account of the work accomplished by the great French
chemist, Lavoisier, I must beg permission to refer very
briefly to the views which he entertained on the subject of
heat-production. The chief significance of these studies of
the fundamental phenomena of animal life is this: they
afforded for the first time a solid basis for the theory of
heat-production in living animals. This theory, formulated
in greater detail, may be stated in the following terms, which
I copy in all important respects from the memoir published
by Rosenthal:—The tissues which compose the body of the
animal, and which are themselves composed of carbon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>hydrogen, oxygen and azote, possess the power of assimilating
a further quantity of oxygen, a quantity somewhat
greater than that which they already contain; and, by
reason of this fact, they are able, as combustion advances,
to accomplish two things—<i>first</i>, to combine with the surplus
oxygen furnished by respiration; and, <i>second</i>, to form carbonic
acid, water and certain azotic matters that are discharged
from the body. It is this process of combustion
which gives rise to heat in the animal’s body and in addition
is associated with a certain loss in its weight. This loss,
however, is limited, for the furnishing of new elements is
going on simultaneously with the casting off of the old, thus
restricting the loss of weight.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is to Lavoisier that the imperishable honor belongs of formulating
the chemical theory of respiration, and of thereby founding
a new era in physiology—the modern era. (Claude Bernard.)</p>

<p class='c019'>Too much stress cannot be laid upon the truth of this
declaration made by Claude Bernard, the great modern
authority in physiology, concerning this, the most important
advance secured for the science of medicine during the
eighteenth century. But alas! many years had to elapse
before the physiologists of that period were able to appreciate
the importance of Lavoisier’s discovery. Very soon
after the announcement of this new theory the leading
chemists of Europe returned almost as a single body to the
old phlogiston doctrine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lavoisier’s portrait is shown in the frontispiece of the
present volume.</p>

<p class='c014'>ENGLISH LEADERS IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY DURING THE EIGHTEENTH AND EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURIES</p>
<p class='c026'><span class='sc'>First Group: Fothergill, Abernethy, James and John
Douglass, Percival Pott and Sir Astley Cooper</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The desire to start the science of medicine on a new
course of growth seemed to develop at the same time in England
that it did on the continent of Europe—that is, during
the first half of the eighteenth century. The prolonged
wars had for a long period of time turned men’s thoughts
entirely aside from scientific inquiries of any kind; but,
the moment the outlook seemed bright for a renewal of
peaceful relations between the warring nations, there arose,
among the men of the different sciences, a strong impulse
to resume their normal labors in the various fields of
research. Some of the evidences of the truth of this statement
have been furnished in the earlier pages of the present
work, and already, during the period which we have now
reached in this brief historical sketch, the proofs are not
lacking that the first fruits of this new harvest are before
us and that we may safely form some idea as to their
quality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of those who should be classed as physicians Fothergill
and Abernethy certainly deserve to be named first. The
latter, I am well aware, is usually classed among the surgeons,
and he certainly deserves to be so classed; but he
seems to me to occupy an equally high position as a medical
philosopher.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>John Fothergill</span>, one of the most distinguished English
physicians of the eighteenth century, was born at Carr End,
Yorkshire, March 8, 1712. He received his early medical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>training at Edinburgh, under the teaching of Monro, Alston,
Sinclair and Plummer, all three of whom had been pupils
of Boerhaave, at Leyden, Holland, and was given the degree
of Doctor of Medicine by the University of Edinburgh, in
1736. During the years immediately following this event,
he visited in turn the principal medical schools of Holland,
Germany and France, and then settled definitively in London.
In 1746 he met with marked success in the treatment
of an epidemic of “putrid sore-throat,” which was raging
in England at that period, and which showed a tendency
to develop into a gangrenous condition. The physicians of
that day employed largely purgatives and bloodletting in
their treatment of this disease, but Fothergill depended
mainly on the cautious use of emetics, mineral acids, bitters
and light wines, the favorite practice among Spanish physicians.
The success which attended his plan of treatment
brought Fothergill a great increase in reputation as well as
in fortune; and thus he was able, in 1762, to purchase at
Upton, in Essex, a large tract of land which he developed
into a splendid garden, where exotic plants of all sorts were
cultivated. He also gathered at this place a very large
collection of zoölogical and mineralogical specimens, which
in the course of time became one of the most complete that
was to be found anywhere in England. From 1765 onward,
in order to relieve his health from the almost constant strain
of so much business, he adopted the habit of absenting himself
from London, regularly every year, for a period of two
months; and with this object in view he chose for his retreat
an attractive residence near Carr End, the town in which he
was born. He died on December 26, 1780, at the age of
sixty-nine, and bequeathed his entire fortune—aside from
a modest stipend which he left to his sister—to the poor.
The inscription written on his tombstone reads as follows:
“Here lies Doctor Fothergill, who spent two-hundred thousand
guineas for the relief of those in distress.” “I do not
believe,” said the immortal Franklin, “that there ever
existed a man who was better entitled to receive the esteem
and veneration of all mankind than was Fothergill.” (Vicq-d’Azyr,
in the Report of the Société Royale, of Paris.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Fothergill did not write a single large treatise, but he
published, in the Philosophic Transactions and elsewhere,
no fewer than forty-one short memoirs on a great variety
of topics.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>John Abernethy</span> was born of Irish parents about the
year 1764. In 1787 he was appointed Assistant Surgeon at
St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, and was promoted to
the position of Surgeon in 1815. From that date to 1827
he served the hospital with great distinction, attaining wide
celebrity as a daring and skilful operator and also as a
lecturer of great power. In his lectures he laid much stress
upon two principles: First, that local diseases had a constitutional
origin; and, second, that this origin could generally
be traced to disorders of the digestive system.</p>

<p class='c007'>George G. Sigmond, M.D., contributed to the <i>London Lancet</i>,
of November 11, 1837, a brief but most satisfactory
biographic sketch of Abernethy, and from this I copy such
portions of the text as are likely to convey to my readers a
more perfect picture of this great physician and surgeon
than I could possibly provide by resorting to a mere compilation
of the facts. Here is his account:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Few individuals who have adorned our profession, possessed a
more clear and accurate knowledge of the principles of our science
than Mr. Abernethy, and no one ever explained them with greater
simplicity, or with less of the entanglement of barbarous and uncouth
names; he was, to the highest degree, plain, and, therefore,
thoroughly intelligible. He had none of the deep learning and
research of his two contemporaries, Dr. Young and Dr. Mason
Good, but he was infinitely their superior in the explanation of
his views, for he did not, as they have done, encumber his writings
with the hard and unintelligible phrases of the Greeks, nor did he
attempt to establish systems founded upon artificial arrangements.
He watched the powers of Nature, he recalled the surgeon to the
path of physic, he showed to him the effect of local disorders upon
the constitution, and the reciprocal operation of constitutional disorders
upon local diseases; he pointed out that the digestive organs
may be affected by local disorder, and that upon the due functioning
of these organs the health of man mainly depends. His object was
to excite, by means of medicine, a more copious and healthy secretion....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>To the knowledge of the necessity of great attention to
the excretions, may chiefly be attributed the increased longevity of
man, and his freedom from many of the diseases of former days.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Abernethy’s mode of pursuing his mercurial course [calomel
and blue pill] was cautious and regular. He prescribed only small
doses, taking care that the error so often fallen into, of increasing
the quantity, when any benefit was perceptible, should be avoided.</p>

<p class='c018'>His death occurred in 1831.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>James Douglass</span>, who was born in Scotland in 1675, died
in London in 1742. During his residence in the English
metropolis he practiced midwifery and taught anatomy.
He was one of those exceptional men (like John Hunter,
for example) who were able both to practice the art of medicine
and to do a great deal of research work. Among other
things he interested himself in the history of medicine and
also took high rank as a botanist. The following list of the
titles of some of his more important contributions to medical
literature illustrate his great versatility:—“<i>Myographiae
comparatae Specimen</i>,” or “a comparative description
of all the muscles in a man and in a quadruped,”
London, 1707; “Description of an Instrument for Extracting
Teeth,” in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. V.;
“History of the Lateral Operation for Extracting the Stone
by making a Wound near the Great Protuberance of the Os
Ischii,” London, 1726; “A Description of the Peritonaeum
and of that part of the membrana cellularis which lies on
its outside, with an account of the true situation of the
abdominal viscera,” London, 1730; “Appendix to the History
of the Lateral Operation for the Stone,” London, 1731.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>John Douglass</span>, a younger brother of the preceding, also
became celebrated as a surgeon. He lived in London, was
connected with the Westminster Hospital, and attained
special distinction through his having revived—after the
lapse of nearly two centuries—the suprapubic operation for
stone in the bladder (Pierre Franco’s “<i>haut appareil</i>”).
His first operation of this nature was performed in 1719.
John Douglass died in 1759.</p>

<p class='c007'>His best-known published treatise bears the title:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Lithotomia Douglassiana,” or a “New Method,” etc.,
London, 1719.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Percival Pott</span> was born at London on December 26, 1713.
Four years later his father died, leaving his widow and son
in possession of very scanty means. In 1729, when sixteen
years of age, Percival was bound an apprentice to Mr.
Nourse, one of the younger surgeons of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital and a lecturer on anatomy in a private medical
school which he established in the heart of London. As it
was Pott’s duty to prepare the subjects for demonstration
he thus enjoyed unusual opportunities for grounding himself
well in the knowledge of anatomy. At the same time,
through his relationship with Mr. Nourse, he found unlimited
opportunities in the hospital for witnessing surgical
operations and for becoming thoroughly familiar with
disease in its different forms. English surgery at this
early period was very crude and unscientific, and—as will
be readily understood—most painful. In his study of different
surgical affections Pott followed the plan advocated
by Lord Bacon, viz., to take up one subject or one region
of the body at a time and to devote all his attention to that
particular subject or region until he had exhausted all
available sources of information relating to the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1736, having finished his apprenticeship, he began at
once making the necessary preparations for entering upon
the practice of his profession. For his residence and place
of business he rented an attractive-looking house in a good
part of London, and took with him his mother and her
daughter by her first husband. Thanks to the brilliancy of
his talents, to an untiring industry and to an attractive personality
and agreeable manners, he soon won for himself a
considerable clientèle; while at the same time acquiring
many friends among the most influential members of his
own profession as well as among the élite of London society
in general. These early friendships, says his biographer,
proved to be permanent; indeed, it may be claimed that few
physicians acquired and retained through life more firm or
more respectable friends.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>In 1744 Pott was elected an Assistant Surgeon, and in
1749 one of the Principal Surgeons, of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital. From 1744 to 1787 he was unremitting in the
surgical work which he performed in this institution. One
of the most important services which he rendered to the
science of medicine may justly be said to consist in the additions
which he made to the scanty knowledge of that period
concerning the nature and proper treatment of that disease
of the spinal column which for many years has borne the
name—in honor of this distinguished surgeon—of “Pott’s
disease of the spine.” His first published memoir concerning
the disease was published in 1779; but it was, as might
be expected, only a preliminary sketch of the subject. Four
years later he gave a complete description of this affection,
the importance of which had for such a long period not been
properly appreciated. In 1786 he received from the Royal
College of Surgeons in Edinburgh a diploma accompanied
by a letter expressive of the high degree of appreciation in
which he was held by that institution. This honor was
greatly enhanced by the fact that Pott was the first person
on whom it had been conferred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pott’s biographer (Sir James Earle, Surgeon Extraordinary
to the King) places the following estimate upon his
character and upon his attainments as a surgeon:—</p>

<p class='c017'>He was the most eminent of his time as a writer, as a teacher,
and as a practitioner in surgery; and his merits in each of these
characters were most extensive. Possessed with an enthusiastic
love of excelling, without which genius is inert, he was not contented
with any kind of mediocrity in himself.</p>

<p class='c018'>As an author, his language is correct, strong and animated....
He introduces anatomy and physiology, whenever it is necessary,
to illustrate and distinguish diseases; but never confuses his reader
with uncertain hypotheses in pathology, founded on physiological
principles. He was of opinion, and it is the opinion of Newton,
that hypothesis has no place in any physical science.... His
remedies always strongly marked his intention; they were decided
and consistent; and he was the principal author of that simplicity
which distinguishes the present practice from that of our ancestors....</p>

<p class='c018'>As a teacher, he had acquired the faculty of speaking readily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>with great point and energy, of delivering the most prolix and
intricate sentences with incredible perspicuity and correctness, and
of enforcing what he said with a most harmonious and expressive
elocution....</p>

<p class='c018'>As a practioner in surgery, we must apply to him all the essential
qualifications—sound judgment, cool determination and great
manual dexterity....</p>

<p class='c018'>In the transaction of business there was a freedom and openness
in his manner, which evidently arose from a consciousness that the
opinion which he delivered was founded on experience.... This
conduct in all situations was an appeal to the good sense of mankind.
Thus he acquired the universal confidence of the profession;
and, without any accidental or external help, he raised himself to
the greatest dignity which man can attain—the first rank in a
liberal profession.</p>

<p class='c019'>Percival Pott wrote a treatise on the necessity of amputation
in certain cases, and in this he strongly refutes the
opinion of a Prussian army surgeon who maintained that
in almost any case it was not necessary to amputate. The
title of the treatise in which this opinion is expressed is “<i>De
membrorum amputatione rarissime administranda, aut quasi
abroganda</i>.” Shortly afterward Dr. Tissot, of Lausanne,
Switzerland, spoke in even stronger terms against this surgical
procedure, even going so far (see his treatise entitled
“<i>Sur l’inutilité de l’amputation des membres</i>”) as to urge
surgeons to abandon the “murderous and cruel method of
amputation”—Pott’s criticism of the views expressed by
these two writers is most charitable: “However, as we must
suppose that the doctrine which these gentlemen have promulgated
arose from humane motives, and upon a conviction
of its being well founded, we must at least applaud their
intention, though we cannot approve their judgment.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Astley Cooper</span> was born at Brooke, in Norfolk, England,
August 23, 1768. As a boy he was fond of all the sports
that are commonly cultivated at English schools, and even
at that early age he manifested a bold and enterprising
spirit, and yet at the same time he was noted for his social
and friendly spirit. His biographer, Pettigrew, who witnessed
many of the operations which Sir Astley performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>at Guy’s Hospital in the earlier years of his career, speaks
in strong terms concerning the impression which he made
upon the regular pupils and the casual physicians who from
time to time attended him on his rounds through the hospital:—</p>

<p class='c017'>I can never forget the enthusiasm with which he entered upon
the performance of any duty calculated to abridge human suffering.
This enthusiasm, by the generosity of his character, his
familiar manner, and the excellence of his temper, he imparted to
all around him—the pupils imbibed the same spirit; and the
extent of the obligations of the present and of after ages to Sir
Astley Cooper, in thus forming able and spirited surgeons, can
never be accurately estimated.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was the idol of the Borough School—the pupils followed him
in troops, and, like to Linnaeus, who has been described as proceeding
upon his botanical excursions accompanied by hundreds of
students, so may Sir Astley be depicted traversing the wards of
the hospital with an equal number of pupils, listening with almost
breathless anxiety to catch the observations which fell from his lips
upon the several cases presented to his view. But, on the days of
operation, this feeling was wound up to the highest pitch—the
sight was altogether deeply interesting; the large theatre of Guy’s
crowded to the ceiling—the profound silence obtained upon his
entry—that person so manly and so truly imposing—and the awful
feeling connected with the occasion—can never be forgotten by any
of his pupils. The elegance of his operation—without the slightest
affectation—all ease—all kindness to the patient, and equally
solicitous that nothing should be hidden from the observation of
the pupils—rapid in execution—masterly in manner—no hurry—no
disorder—the most trifling minutiae attended to—the dressings
generally applied by his own hand ... Sir Astley was, at that
time (about 1805–1810), decidedly one of the first operators of the
day, and this must be taken in its widest sense, for it is intended to
include the planning of the operation, the precision and dexterity
in the mode of its performance, and the readiness with which all
difficulties were met and overcome.</p>

<p>SIR ASTLEY COOPER<br /><br />(Copied from a print in the possession of the New York Academy of Medicine.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Among the contributions which Sir Astley made to the
science of medicine the following deserve to receive special
mention:—In 1798 he published the report of a remarkable
case of strangulated hernia in which a part of the abdominal
viscera was protruded into the left cavity of the chest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>through an opening in the diaphragm. The viscera were
much displaced from their natural situation, and the great
arch of the colon, together with a large portion of the
omentum, was pushed through the aperture in the diaphragm.
The existence of this opening, which represented
a congenital malformation, was first ascertained after
death. It seems almost needless to add that, even if this
unusual condition of the parts had been known during the
patient’s lifetime, no possible means of relief could have
been afforded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another of Sir Astley’s contributions—one, namely,
which he published in 1804—deals with the subject of inguinal
hernia, a topic concerning which very little was known
before Cooper’s time. The Spanish surgeon, Gimbernat,
had—it is true—published at a still earlier date a masterly
description of the anatomy of the parts concerned in this
form of hernia, but the fact had been entirely forgotten
until Sir Astley called attention to its importance. Mr.
Lawrence, the distinguished English surgeon, makes the
statement (1806) that “no complete description and accurate
delineation of even the common kinds of hernia, as the
inguinal, femoral, and umbilical, existed previously to the
late excellent works of Camper, Cooper, Scarpa, Hesselbach,
Cloquet and Langenbeck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Vol. I. of the Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical
Society (1808) will be found a report, by Sir Astley, of two
cases of aneurism of the carotid artery. Pettigrew says
that the first of these two cases was treated by ligature upon
the vessel—the first of the kind on record, and establishing
a practice which has since been pursued and successfully
adopted. The second one of the two cases mentioned at the
beginning of this paragraph—also a case of aneurism of the
carotid—was treated by ligature and with a completely successful
result. This patient lived until 1821, at which time
Sir Astley published an account of the dissection made by
him of the parts involved in the region of the earlier
aneurism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Astley Cooper is the first surgeon to whom we are
indebted for the performance of an operation designed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>remedy in a measurable degree—in a few cases even to cure—the
malformation known as <i>Spina bifida</i>, a condition which
consists of a deficiency of the spinous processes of the vertebrae
by which the theca enclosing the spinal marrow distends
and protrudes to such a degree as to form a tumor,
any opening into which has been commonly considered as
necessarily attended by fatal effects. Sir Astley attributes
the successful issue of the cases under his care to the
employment of needles, and not the lancet, to discharge the
fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many other instructive cases were reported by Sir Astley
in later years, but the lack of space does not permit me to
mention them here. It is enough for me to state that in his
“Lectures on the Principles and Practice of Surgery” (published
by Mr. F. Tyrrell, Surgeon of St. Thomas’s Hospital)
very full details are furnished concerning all of Sir Astley’s
operative work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the honors conferred upon this distinguished surgeon
during the later years of his life the following deserve
to be mentioned: President of the College of Surgeons in
1827; Surgeon to the King in 1828; and Vice-President of
the Royal Society in 1830. His income is said to have risen
in 1813 to the very large sum of £21,000 ($105,000). His
death occurred in 1841.</p>

<p class='c014'>ENGLISH LEADERS IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
DURING THE EIGHTEENTH AND EARLY NINETEENTH
CENTURIES</p>
<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Second Group: William and John Hunter and Sir
Benjamin Brodie</span>
My information concerning the Hunter Brothers is based
upon data which I found in Pettigrew’s “Medical Portrait
Gallery,” Parkinson’s “Hunterian Reminiscences,” and
a few other published documents.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>William Hunter</span>, the elder of the two brothers who
attained such marked distinction in the world of medicine
during the eighteenth century, was born in 1718 in the west
of Scotland. During his early manhood he devoted his
attention to the study of theology at the College of Glasgow;
but, losing soon his interest in these studies, he turned his
attention to medicine, a branch of science which he found
much more congenial. His advance in this new field of
labor was rapid, for already at the age of twenty-eight he
was invited by a society of naval surgeons to deliver a
course of lectures on operative surgery. Two years later
(in 1748) he became connected with the Middlesex Hospital
and the British Lying-in Hospital, and from that time forward
his chief interest was centred in obstetrics. Rising
rapidly in public favor it was not long before he acquired a
large fortune. In 1764 he became Physician Extraordinary
to Queen Charlotte, and in 1768 was appointed Professor of
Anatomy in the Royal Academy.</p>

<p class='c007'>His greatest work, which was begun in 1751 and published
in 1783, bears the title: “An Anatomical Description of the
Human Gravid Uterus and its Contents.” Pettigrew speaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of this work, which eventually comprised thirty-four plates
(drawn from Hunter’s dissections and engraved by some
of the best English engravers),</p>

<p class='c017'>as one of the most splendid medical works ever published. It is
not, perhaps too much to say that the engravings have never been
surpassed.... A period of thirty years was necessary, to obtain
sufficient instances to develop all the changes occurring in the human
uterus during the progress of gestation.... The treatise upon
this subject was intended to be a separate production; but Dr.
Hunter did not live to publish it. It remained for his nephew, Dr.
Baillie, to submit this to the profession, which he did in 1794, as
an “Anatomical Description of the Gravid Uterus and its
Contents.”</p>

<p class='c019'>One of Dr. Hunter’s cherished ideas was to establish in
London an anatomical school upon a most extensive scale;
for, strange as it must now appear, no regular courses of
anatomy were given prior to 1746, and as a consequence
surgery and physiology made but slow advancement. As a
first step toward the realization of his pet scheme he submitted
a memorial to the Earl of Bute, the First Lord of
the Treasury, setting forth the great need of such a school,
and furnishing with the memorial a suitable plan for establishing
a museum in which the necessary instruction might
be carried on. The memorial and accompanying plan were
submitted to the King, but the proposal eventually fell to
the ground. In view of the lack of interest manifested by
the Government, Hunter decided to devote his own fortune
and the collections which he had gathered up to that time to
the establishment of the contemplated school. Accordingly
he purchased an extensive piece of property and built upon
it a large cabinet or institute in which every facility was
provided for anatomical work: laboratories, amphitheatre,
etc. In his will a provision was made that this institute with
all its equipment should remain in London until thirty years
had elapsed from the date of his death, and then it should
be transferred to Glasgow. His death occurred on March
30, 1783.</p>

<p>WILLIAM HUNTER<br /><br />(Copied from Thomas J. Pettigrew’s “Medical Portrait Gallery,” Fisher &amp; Son, London, 1838. The original portrait was painted by Pyne; the engraving was done by J. Thomson.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The institute which Dr. William Hunter founded was “for
the improvement of anatomical knowledge, surgery and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>physics,” and it may therefore with justice be claimed that
Dr. William Hunter was the founder of the anatomical
schools of Great Britain upon a rational and extended plan.
His nephew, Dr. Baillie, speaks of him as a teacher and
scientific worker in the following terms:—</p>

<p class='c017'>No one ever possessed more enthusiasm for his art, more persevering
industry, more acuteness of investigation, more perspicuity
of expression, or, indeed, a greater share of natural
eloquence. He excelled very much any lecturer whom I have ever
heard, in the clearness of his arrangement, the aptness of his illustrations,
and the elegance of his diction. He was, perhaps, the
best teacher of anatomy that ever lived.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>John Hunter</span>, who was born July 14, 1728, was the
youngest member of this large family of children, and, as
a natural result, his early education was greatly neglected.
Then, as a further misfortune, he lost his father by death
before he himself had attained his eleventh year. Although
he was regularly sent to school he did little else, up to the
age of twenty, but waste his time. Then, bored to death by
the aimless sort of life he was leading, and learning about
this time what a fine reputation his brother William was
building up through the work that he was doing in London,
he asked him by letter whether he could not give him some
regular occupation in his laboratory, stating, at the same
time, that if he could not do this, he (John) would immediately
enlist as a soldier. William wrote to his brother to
come on to London and he would see what he could do for
him. Immediately after John’s arrival in the great metropolis
he was given anatomical work to do, and, to the astonishment
of his brother William, he soon displayed such a
remarkable degree of skill as a dissector that there could no
longer be any reasonable doubt about his ability to gain
eminence in this line of work; and so he was encouraged to
give it a full trial. William took special pains to point out to
his brother the best technical methods of procedure, and in
every possible manner aided him in his efforts to advance.
Thus, for example, he gained admission for him to Oxford
University, and in due time obtained opportunities for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>to witness the operative work of the leading surgeons in
several of the London hospitals. With the lapse of time,
during the following years John became more and more
closely associated with his brother in his different activities,—lecturing
in his place whenever he was called away by
other matters of importance, making those beautiful anatomical
specimens which even to-day are such a striking
feature of the Hunter Museum in London, and guiding the
students in their work of dissecting. But the field in which
he displayed a tireless activity, and in which up to the very
end he gained the greatest personal satisfaction from his
labors, was that of comparative anatomy and experimental
physiology and pathology. It was in this field that he performed
the largest amount of original work, and almost
always with a view to learning how the different classes of
animals were equipped for the performance of one and the
same function. About the year 1761 his health began to give
way and he was obliged to spend nearly two years in efforts
to regain it. With this object in view, he accepted the position
of surgeon in the army, and during the period covered
by the years 1761 and 1762 visited Belle-Isle, on the west
coast of France, and also Portugal. On his return to England
with improved health he resumed work on the anatomy
of the uterus and especially on the lymphatics of that organ,
and made not a few actual discoveries in this his new field.
This work was conducted by him with great zest, and as a
result he soon began to be the recipient of honors from
different scientific societies. He was made a member of
the Royal Society of London, and associate of the Society
of London Surgeons and also of several German and French
scientific societies, and Attending Surgeon of St. George’s
Hospital, Surgeon Extraordinary to the King, Surgeon-General
of the English Army, etc. In 1783 he experienced
his first attack of <i>angina pectoris</i>, and these attacks continued
to occur with increasing frequency until the final one,
which ended his life on October 16, 1793.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his biographical notice of John Hunter, Odier quotes
Lavater, the famous physiognomist, as saying—after he had
gazed for a few moments on Hunter’s portrait: “This man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>is accustomed to do his own thinking.” Lavater’s judgment,
adds Dezeimeris, is amply justified by the facts. “No matter
what was the subject upon which he wrote—whether surgery,
medicine or physiology—he always added to it a certain
measure of originality. In reading his writings one
is constantly tempted to question the correctness of the
opinion which one may have previously formed with regard
to the particular subject under consideration, and it is in
this respect—viz., by suggesting thought—that Hunter rendered
very great services to his art. And yet, at the same
time, it is precisely in his writings that the evidences of
neglect in his early education stand out in the strongest
relief; a neglect which showed itself most conspicuously in
incorrectness, obscurity and slovenliness of style.”
(Dezeimeris.) This critic adds that ample proof of the
correctness of this judgment may be found in Hunter’s
treatise “On the Blood and Inflammation,”—a book which
is “full of grand and beautiful ideas that are literally
choked in a chaos of conflicting conceptions, unfinished
phrases, new words or words used in a sense different from
that in which they are commonly employed.” I should add
here, however, that the fault of which the biographer last
quoted complains appears to be entirely absent in certain
of Hunter’s reports of cases, as for instance in that which
contains the account of a fractured thigh. At the same
time it must be admitted that the physician who presumably
prepared this report from notes which he took when
Hunter delivered the lectures upon which the report is
based, may have so edited the text as completely to eliminate
the objectionable features. In our ignorance of the
exact truth, it is more agreeable to assume that, in this particular
instance, the lecturer revealed his ability to avoid
entirely the faults to which the critic refers and to set forth
the facts and his accompanying comments with perfect
clearness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here follows the report as it is printed in the “Hunterian
Reminiscences”:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Granulation is not always confined to a breach of the solids by
suppuration; for parts are capable of making new animal matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>internally, in cases where it ought to have been healed by the first
intention. What gave me the first idea of this was the following
case, and the appearance observed on dissection, as exhibited in
the preparation of the parts.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Case.</span>—I was called to a man with a fractured thigh, and employed
the usual means, but without success, for no union of the
fractured parts was formed in the usual time; and at about the
end of four weeks the man died with some other complaint. Upon
examination of the parts I found that the upper end of the bone
rode considerably over the under, and, consequently, there was a
great cavity in the soft parts, the parietes of which were thickened
by the adhesive inflammation, though not so much as if the parts
had been better disposed for the adhesive inflammation. There
was no extravasated blood, nor matter, nor coagulable lymph, to
be found, except a few threads, which probably were the remains of
some extravasated blood. Here the parts had lost two chances of
being united, the one by the extravasated blood, the other by the
coagulable lymph thrown out by the adhesive inflammation; and
nature had here begun a third, which was that of forming granulations
of new animal matter on the ends of the bones, and the surface
of the surrounding cavity; and adhesions, you see, have taken
place between the bones and soft parts, by which the bones would
have been united by bony case: hence we find that granulation may
take place without suppuration. This mode of union by granulation
is much more extensive, I believe, than has been imagined; this
third bond of union taking place when the parts have missed the
first and second, as just mentioned. In the exposure of cavities
of abscesses we have granulations going on hand in hand, and following
suppuration. As the suppurative inflammation follows injuries
with exposure, it seems that this inflammation is in general
necessary to granulation in these cases. Granulation is an accretion
of new animal matter, the old vessels being extended, and new
ones formed, the vessels passing from one edge of the surface
toward the other. Granulations are always of the same nature
with the part on which they are formed: if that is diseased, as
with any specific disease, so are they also. The granulating surface
is convex, and covered with prominent points; the colour is of a
deep florid red, but, when unhealthy, is of a livid colour, which,
perhaps, may be produced by the circulation through them being
exceedingly slow; this change of colour may also be an effect of
difference of position.</p>

<p>JOHN HUNTER<br /><br />(Copied from Thomas J. Pettigrew’s “Medical Portrait Gallery,” London, 1838. The original portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds; the engraving was done by G. H. Adcock.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Hunter’s biographer in the “New International Encyclopaedia”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>speaks of him as a man of great industry, the
boldest and best operating surgeon of his day as well as the
greatest anatomist known and a marvelous zoölogist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some idea of the intensity of Hunter’s devotion to the
cause of science may be obtained from a perusal of the following
incident, which is related in A. M. W. Stirling’s
“Coke of Norfolk and His Friends”:<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Epping Place may be said to have been the centre of his [Coke’s]
operations; and there was in these days a celebrated Irish giant
O’Brien or O’Bryne who came to live there solely for the sake of
joining Mr. Coke’s hounds whenever he allowed himself any recreation.
O’Brien was eight feet high in 1780 and apparently went on
growing, for in 1782 he measured two inches more and after his
death in 1783 he was found to measure eight feet four inches, yet
no other member of his family was unusually tall. He was crazy
about hunting and became so attached to Jones, Mr. Coke’s huntsman,
that he paid the latter a visit at Holkam and was there
solemnly introduced by Jones to Mr. Coke and his guests.
O’Brien’s end was curious. With extreme simplicity he invested
all his property in a single banknote of seven hundred pounds
which, needless to say, he lost; and grief at his loss combined with
excessive drinking brought about his death. John Hunter, the
celebrated surgeon, was extremely anxious to secure his skeleton;
and learning that the giant was dying he set his men to watch the
house in order to be sure of getting the body. O’Brien hearing of
this, and having a horror of being dissected, left orders that his
corpse should be watched night and day until a lead coffin could be
made, in which it was to be conveyed to the Downs and sunk in
twenty fathoms of water. O’Brien died, and his body started for
the Nee, escorted by a walking wake of thirty Irishmen who drank
deeply <i>en route</i>. Howison, Hunter’s man, who watched closely,
informed the surgeon when he might catch the bodyguard off duty
at the public house, and Hunter went thither to bribe them. He
offered fifty guineas to one of the men to allow the body to be kidnapped,
and the man consented on his own account, but said that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>he must first consult with his companions, who, perceiving Hunter’s
eagerness, raised their price, first to one hundred pounds and finally
to five hundred before they would agree. Hunter borrowed the
money to pay them, and the coffin consequently went on its way
filled with stones, while the body of the dead giant journeyed back
to London in a spring cart, until John Hunter’s own carriage met
it, after dark, and drove it to his house in Earl’s Court. There,
for fear of detection, he did not dare to dissect it; but, separating
the flesh from the bones by boiling and cutting, he quickly skeletonized
it. Hence in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons
may be seen, to-day, the skeleton—brown from boiling—of the
giant whose greatest joy when living was a gallop with Mr. Coke’s
hounds and the friendship of Mr. Coke’s huntsman.</p>

<p class='c019'>At the time of Hunter’s death, his museum contained
10,563 specimens and preparations illustrative of human
and comparative anatomy, physiology, pathology and natural
history. He died, however, in comparative poverty,
and his collection was purchased, two years after his death,
by the Government for £15,000 and was presented to the
Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Hunter, says Pettigrew, had some very good ideas
regarding the educational training of the pupils who placed
themselves under his guidance. One of these is revealed
in his practice of receiving certain pupils into his house.
In this way several of England’s most distinguished physicians
came to be, for varying periods of time, inmates of
his home, and among this number—to mention only a single
instance—was Dr. Jenner, the inventor of vaccination.
One or more physicians from the United States—if I
am rightly informed—also enjoyed this privilege. Valuable
as this practice must have been to those who were
thus given the opportunity of frequent informal intercourse
with a most inspiring master, it certainly could not have
been an easy matter, even in those more primitive days, to
fit these pupils into the régime of the teacher’s home life;
and, under the conditions of modern life, the arrangement
would certainly prove impracticable.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Benjamin Collins Brodie</span> was born at Milford, near
Salisbury, England, on June 9, 1783. In 1803, when he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>twenty years of age, he became Sir Everard Home’s pupil
at St. George’s Hospital, London. Two years later he began
to assist Mr. Wilson in teaching anatomy, and during the
following four years he filled the position of Demonstrator
of Anatomy. In 1808, a year and a half before he began
private practice, he was appointed assistant to Sir Everard
Home at St. George’s Hospital, and retained the position
up to the time (1822) when he was appointed full surgeon
at that institution. About six months after Mr. Brodie
received his appointment as Assistant Surgeon, he began
lecturing on surgery and continued giving instruction on
this subject up to 1830. In addition, he gave clinical lectures
regularly to large classes, and this most important
part of his work, which he began in 1813, was kept up by
him through a long period of years. In 1819 he was appointed
Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the Royal
College of Surgeons, a position which he held until 1823.
In that year, upon the death of Sir Everard Home, he was
appointed one of the Serjeant-Surgeons to the King. Two
years later a baronetcy was conferred upon him, an honor
which gave him the right to be addressed as Sir Benjamin
Brodie.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the history of medicine one can find only a few
instances of men who were very clever surgeons and at the
same time highly gifted physiologists. A study of the life
and writings of Sir Benjamin Brodie reveals clearly that
he is a conspicuous instance of this kind. The very limited
space at my command does not permit me to furnish more
than a few incomplete proofs of the truth of what I have
just stated. Such are, for example, the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1810 Sir Benjamin Brodie delivered the Croonian
lecture before the Royal Society, the subject chosen being
“On some Physiological Researches respecting the Influence
of the Brain on the Action of the Heart, and on the
Generation of Animal Heat.” His experiments, according
to the account given by his biographer, “go to show that if
respiration can be maintained, even artificially, the heart
will continue to contract with strength and frequency, even
though the spinal cord be divided from the brain.” Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Brodie contrived an apparatus to effect this, and at the
same time carefully noted the circumstances connected with
the secretion of the urine, which in these experiments was
found to be suppressed. The conclusions he has drawn
from this inquiry, conducted with great precision and
detailed with equal perspicuity, are the following:—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The influence of the brain is not directly necessary to the
action of the heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>2. When the brain is injured or removed, the action of the
heart ceases, only because respiration is under its influence; and if
under these circumstances respiration is artificially produced, the
circulation will still continue.</p>

<p class='c018'>3. When the influence of the brain is cut off, the secretion of
urine appears to cease, and no heat is generated; notwithstanding
the functions of respiration and the circulation of the blood continue
to be performed, and the usual changes in the appearance of
the blood are produced in the lungs.</p>

<p class='c018'>4. When the air respired is colder than the natural temperature
of the animal, the effect of respiration is not to generate, but to
diminish animal heat.</p>

<p class='c019'>In 1811 Sir Benjamin Brodie reported to the Royal
Society the results of various experiments which he made
on the different modes in which death is produced by certain
vegetable poisons (for example, alcohol; the essential
oil of bitter almonds; the juice of the leaves of aconite; the
infusion of tobacco; the empyreumatic oil of tobacco; the
curare; etc.). During the following year he reported to
the same society the results of a similar series of experiments
which he made upon the effects produced by certain
mineral poisons (for example, arsenic, muriate of barytes,
tartar emetic, and corrosive sublimate).</p>

<p class='c007'>The preceding brief references to the experimental work
carried on by Sir Benjamin Brodie must suffice to show how
thoroughly he deserved to be ranked as one of the leading
English experimental physiologists of his day.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among Sir Benjamin Brodie’s contributions to the
science of surgery are many that may be classed as of the
first importance. Such, for example, are his researches
respecting the diseases of the joints; his remarks on a case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of ununited fracture of the femur, in the course of which
he praises the method of treatment first proposed by Dr.
Physick of Philadelphia; his observations on the treatment
of varicose veins of the legs; pathological and surgical
observations relating to injuries of the brain—a contribution
of very great value; and pathological and surgical
observations on the diseases of the joints. The latter treatise,
which already, in 1836, had reached its fourth edition,
is mentioned by his biographer as “a book which must ever
form an essential part of the library of every surgeon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Like all his predecessors who have given instruction in
the art of surgery, from John Hunter to Desault, Sir Benjamin
Brodie laid great stress upon the importance of an
intimate knowledge of anatomy and physiology—of the
inseparable connection of these branches of science, and of
the interest derivable from a contemplation of the organization
and functions of animal bodies, the laws which regulate
the phenomena of life and the changes which matter
undergoes, and the form which it assumes when associated
with this mysterious and active principle.... “He believes
them to be incapable of explanation, except on the hypothesis
of there being in living bodies something superadded
to organization, without which, he says, ‘they would be as
incapable of executing their functions as the pendulum of
a clock would be of vibrating, or its wheels of revolving, if
they were deprived of the spring or weight, in which the
cause of their motion resides.’” (Pettigrew.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The matters referred to above are only a few of those
which Sir Benjamin Brodie has discussed in so instructive
a manner in the numerous short essays and larger treatises
which he published between the years 1809 and 1837. His
death occurred in 1862.</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>Second Group (Continued): Sir Charles Bell and John Bell</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Among the contemporaries of Sir Benjamin Brodie there
were several London surgeons who, by reason of the important
parts which they played in building up this branch of
the science and art of medicine, fully deserve such consideration
in the present review as my limited space will permit,
and also as the sources of information upon which I am
forced to depend for guidance may or may not prove helpful.
Most fortunately for me at this juncture of affairs was
the finding—among the rich treasures of the Medical
Library of the former Transylvania University, at Lexington,
Kentucky—of Professor Roux’s account of a visit which
he made to the English metropolis in 1814 for the purpose
of learning at first hand precisely how the English surgeons
of that day were dealing with the more important
problems which they were called upon to solve. A more
competent and fair-minded authority than Dr. Roux could
scarcely have been found at that time for the task which he
set before himself. In the first place he was himself an
eminent surgeon, in fact the Professor of Anatomy,
Physiology and Surgery at the <i>Faculté de Médecine</i> of
Paris, and at the same time he was wholly free from the
animosity which most naturally pervaded a large part of
the French nation in 1814 (just before the battle of Waterloo).
And the very best evidence that he performed his
judicial task to the entire satisfaction of the medical men
of Great Britain is to be found in the fact that an English
translation of his elaborate report reached a second edition
in 1816. I therefore feel confident that, in basing my résumé
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>largely upon Dr. Roux’s report regarding the condition of
English surgery in the second decade of the nineteenth
century, I shall not go far astray from the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his review of past events in the broad domain of surgery
Roux says that the English attribute the first idea of
the circular amputation of limbs to Cheselden, whereas the
French give the credit for this operation to J. L. Petit.
Then there are other operations which were devised or
revived simultaneously by English and French surgeons—as,
for example, in external aneurism, the tying of the
diseased artery above the tumor (Desault and John
Hunter), and the operation for <i>Fistula in ano</i>—an operation
which was brought to the greatest degree of simplicity
by Pott, Desault and some others.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, there are many operations which were
devised or perfected exclusively by French surgeons—for
example, the method of extracting the crystalline lens, by
Daviel; the treatment of fistula lachrymalis by dilating the
nasal canal; the treatment of strangulated hernia by Goursand,
Pipelet, Louis and others; the lateral operation
(perinaeal) for removal of a calculus in the bladder; the
operation of Frère Jacques; hypogastric lithotomy by
Pierre Franco, and perfected by Frère Côme; etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English surgeons may similarly claim priority in
proposing certain operations, as for example, that of perforation
of the <i>os unguis</i> for establishing an artificial passage
for the tears, by Woolhouse; Cheselden created the
operation of the artificial pupil; he is also to be credited
with the operation of perforating the duct of Steno, on the
inside of the mouth and some distance from its natural
orifice, for the relief of salivary fistula; Pott’s description
of and treatment for what is known as Pott’s disease of
the spine; etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, passing from what may be termed the history of
ancient English surgery, Roux devotes his attention next
to the work which was being done, at the time of his visit
to London, by some of the leading surgeons of that city;
and among his most striking brief comments I find the
following: “There are many able surgeons in London at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the present time”; and “The English seem to have a strong
taste for surgery.” Farther on, he discusses at greater
length the reasons why the English surgeons maintain such
pleasant relations with one another, and notes with pleasure
how greatly the prevalence of such professional harmony
conduces to the general advancement of the science and art
of surgery—or, for that matter, to the advancement of any
art or science. His words read as follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'>If anything can contribute to keep alive the taste for an art or
science, to extend its progress, and to make a greater number of
men excel in it, is it not that those who cultivate it should live in
perfect intelligence together; that they should compose one family;
that they have frequent meetings with one another, in which each
one, sacrificing his own private interest, brings, without pride or
without presumption, the fruit of his own reflections; that,
strangers to the arts of intrigue, and, never giving their minds to
the vile insinuations of envy, they should rival one another only
in zeal and knowledge? Well, this fraternal spirit, this absence
of all jealous rivalry; and more, an ardent desire to communicate,
reciprocally, their views, their thoughts, exists in a very high degree
amongst the men who are at this moment the honour of medicine
and surgery at London. This is what I have observed by being
amongst them, I will not say with surprise, but with the highest
satisfaction. To these common sentiments is joined, on the part of
those men already advanced in their career, an esteem altogether
peculiar, for those whose reputation is but beginning; and, on the
part of the latter, the greatest regard, the most sincere respect for
those who were their masters.</p>

<p class='c019'>At this point I beg to remind my readers that effective
surgical anaesthesia had not yet at that early period been
discovered, and this fact, I scarcely need to add, must have
deterred many men from undertaking some of the more
serious surgical operations.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of Roux’s account he sums up the results of
his observations of English surgery in the following
words:—</p>

<p class='c017'>If I must conclude by a summary opinion, I would say that, with
respect to the art of surgery, as with respect to its habits and
institutions; in whatever light we consider it, England is the place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>for contrasts. By the side of the most brilliant features, English
surgery exhibits glaring imperfections—French surgery is more
generally good.</p>

<p class='c019'>While we are now considering various matters relating
to the condition of surgery in England and her colonies
during the early part of the nineteenth century, it may not
seem out of place to mention here a discovery which was
announced just about that time, and which, I suspect, is
known to-day to comparatively few American physicians.
During the eighteenth century the opinion was widely held
that gonorrhoea is simply one of the manifestations of
syphilis and that consequently mercury is required for its
cure. The existence of such a belief among the physicians
of that day explains the following statement which I find
printed in Vol. I. of the Quarterly Journal of Foreign Medicine
and Surgery for 1818:—“Dr. Francis Balfour, a physician
highly esteemed in Calcutta, states that when he was a
student in Edinburgh he attempted to establish the idea
that gonorrhoea is a disease distinct from syphilis and does
not require mercury for its cure. He put forward this doctrine
in a paper which he presented to the Medical Society
of Edinburgh, and which still, we believe, graces its records.
This was as early as the year 1766. Next year he made it
the subject of his inaugural dissertation.... It was nearly
twenty years after this period that Benjamin Bell, by his
ingenious and able investigations, supported and further
confirmed the opinion, and thus contributed much to bring
it into public notoriety and favour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of Dr. Roux’s visit to London <span class='sc'>Charles Bell</span>,
who had taken up his residence in that city in 1804, was
already well advanced on the high road to distinction as a
surgeon. Born at Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1774, he had
attained considerable reputation as an anatomist and
physiologist by the publication (1798–1800) (in association
with his brother, John Bell) of a very useful “System of
Dissection of the Human Body,” in which he describes not
only the normal conditions but also the alterations produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>by disease. The text is interspersed with instructive
remarks concerning human physiology. Particularly clear
and interesting—says his biographer—are the descriptions
which Bell gives of the structure of the heart and blood-vessels.
He refutes in strong terms the teachings of Hunter
regarding the vital force of the blood and the doctrine of
Crawford with regard to animal heat; and “his explanation
of the physiology of respiration is the clearest and most
satisfactory of any of the accounts that are to be found
in the textbooks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the domain of experimental physiology Charles Bell
discovered, at a later date, that, in the case of certain nerve
trunks (<i>e.g.</i>, the trigeminus), what appeared to be a <i>single
nerve</i> was in reality made up of two entirely different
(physiologically speaking) nerves, one of which is now
termed the <i>portio major</i>, while the other bears the name of
<i>portio minor</i>. Bell also demonstrated experimentally the
important law that the anterior roots of the spinal cord
nerves are the outgoing (centrifugal) motor nerves, the
posterior the incoming (centripetal) sensible nerves. These
results were subsequently fully confirmed by the great German
physiologist, Johannes Mueller. In ancient times the
question was often discussed whether one and the same
nerve might not carry both sensory and motor impulses.
The discovery just mentioned is one of the most important
ever made in physiology.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great as was the reputation attained by Charles Bell as
an experimental physiologist,—a reputation which won for
him the honor of knighthood on the accession of William IV.
to the throne,—he soon, as was predicted by Roux, became
one of the most celebrated surgeons of London. His work
as an operator was carried on chiefly at the Middlesex Hospital.
Roux speaks of him as a “graceful operator without
being affected.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As an author he should be credited with the following
treatises:—“Anatomy of Expression” (1806); “System
of Operative Surgery”; “Animal Mechanics” (1828);
“Nervous System” (1830).</p>

<p>SIR CHARLES BELL<br /><br />(Copied from a print in the possession of the New York Academy of Medicine.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Sir Charles Bell’s death occurred in 1842.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Sir Charles Bell’s older brother, <span class='sc'>John Bell</span>, born at
Edinburgh in 1763, was also a distinguished anatomist and
surgeon. After traveling for a short time in Russia and the
north of Europe he returned to Edinburgh in 1786 and
began to deliver lectures on surgery and midwifery. From
this time forward his private practice as a consulting and
operating surgeon steadily increased, until finally, in 1796,
he was obliged to discontinue his lectures and devote his
entire time to his patients and to the preparation of the
several publications of which he was the author. Early in
1816 he was thrown by a spirited horse, and was so seriously
injured that he never entirely recovered from the effects
of the accident. His death occurred in 1820.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the works which he published the following
deserve to receive special mention: “The Anatomy of the
Human Body” (1793–1802), in the third edition of which
work (1811) are to be found a number of plates that were
drawn by his brother, Charles Bell; “Engravings of the
Bones, Muscles and Joints,” drawn and engraved by himself
(1794); “The Principles of Surgery” (1801–1808); and
“Letters on Professional Character.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking of the second volume of the first-mentioned
work (“The Anatomy,” etc.) Sprengel, the author of an
important German history of medicine, says: “It is remarkable
in two respects, viz., for the unusual number of interesting
facts which it contains and also for the marked
excellence of the plates that accompany the text.”</p>

<p class='c014'>BORDEU AND BICHAT; THE BEGINNING OF EXPERIMENTAL
PHYSIOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL
PATHOLOGY IN FRANCE</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Théophile Bordeu</span> was born at Iseste, in the region of
the Pyrenees, on February 22, 1722. He received his preparatory
education at the College of the Jesuits, in Pau.
Later, he entered the Medical School at Montpellier, and
received his doctor’s degree from that institution in 1744.
After graduation he devoted much of his time to giving
instruction in anatomy, believing, as he did, in Seneca’s
motto—“Doceo ut Discam” (I teach in order that I may
learn). Notwithstanding the demands made upon his time
by his private practice and by his numerous other engagements
(inspection of the mineral springs in the neighboring
region, courses of lectures to midwives, etc.) he managed
to accomplish considerable research work, and one of the
first fruits of these original studies is to be found in a
<i>mémoire</i> which he wrote on the articulations of the bones
of the face. This treatise, which he sent to the <i>Académie
Royale des Sciences</i>, was received with marked favor, as
shown by the facts that it was published by that body in
their <i>Recueil des Savans Étrangers</i> and that its author was
elected a Corresponding Member. In this treatise Bordeu
calls attention to the fact that all the bones which form the
background of the face are arranged in such a manner as
to offer efficient resistance to the repeated upward impulses
of the lower jaw, which impulses, acting upon the superior
dental arch, have a constant tendency to push upward or
to drive apart outwardly the bones into which the teeth of
this arch are implanted. To appreciate fully the very
creditable character of this essay the reader must remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>that Bordeu had not yet reached his thirtieth year and that
the ideas which he sets forth in this essay are the strict
product of his own thinking and anatomical researches.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1752 Bordeu moved to Paris, and soon afterward published
one of his best contributions to the science of medicine,
viz., a monograph entitled: “<i>Recherches Anatomiques
sur la Position des Glandes, et sur leur Action</i>.” The publication
of this important and exhaustive mémoire occurred
so soon after its author reached Paris that one is justified
in assuming that all or the greater part of the research work
upon which the essay is based was carried on at Montpellier.
The object aimed at by Bordeu in this <i>mémoire</i>
was to prove that</p>
<p class='c023'>“the secretions which issue from these glandular organs represent
a veritable elaboration of the liquid the elements of which are
supplied by the blood, and are not merely a simple separation, as
the term ‘secretion’ would seem to imply. This function,” says
Bordeu, “is the result of the activities belonging properly to the
gland as an organ, and does not in any sense—as some would have
us believe—represent a mere mechanical relationship between the
blood-vessels of the gland and the volume of the globules (blood
corpuscles) that are carried into the organ through them. Nor does
the function represent in the slightest degree the result of a
chemical affinity between the fluid product secreted and the substance
of the gland. Furthermore, the excretion (<i>i.e.</i>, the expulsion)
of this fluid product is due wholly to the vital action of the
glandular organ; for it is a well-known fact that the adjacent
muscles and organs occupy such positions in relation to the glands
themselves that they are quite powerless to compress them and
thus to favor expulsion of the fluid which they have secreted.
Indeed, their influence is of quite the contrary character; instead
of compressing these organs in the manner claimed they do no
more than to communicate to them from time to time such trifling
shocks and movements as favor their glandular activity....
Modern physiologists have added nothing of importance to what
Bordeu has set forth in this <i>mémoire</i>, which deserves to be
looked upon as one of the finest monuments that has ever been
erected in honor of the science of man.” (Richerand.)</p>
<p class='c019'>Bordeu’s <i>mémoire</i>, it seems, created a great sensation
among the physicians of Paris, many of whom were still at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>that period ardent supporters of the mechanical and chemical
doctrines taught by Boerhaave; and, as a matter of
course, there was also unbounded curiosity among the
better-educated physicians of the capital to see and make
the acquaintance of the newcomer—this “young athlete,”
as Richerand calls him,—who had not feared to enter the
lists against such a formidable array of adversaries. The
marked popularity that fell to Bordeu’s lot as a private
practitioner in Paris after this brilliant beginning was not,
however, of long continuance. Professional jealousy rarely
fails to develop promptly when a physician manifests his
ability to win patients from those of his colleagues who, for
a certain number of years, have been established in practice,
and this is precisely what happened in Bordeu’s case.
The new <i>mémoires</i> which he published during the succeeding
years—one on the pulse (in 1756), a second on “Metallic
Colic” (in 1761–1763), a third on the “Colic of Poitou”
(a year or two later), and a fourth on the “History of
Medicine” (in 1768)—showed unmistakable evidences of
the great talents which he possessed, but they attracted comparatively
little attention and did not add to his popularity
as a private practitioner. Furthermore, he derived very
little if any material advantage from his appointment as
one of the attending physicians at <i>La Charité</i> hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last two years of his relatively short life were
attended with not a little suffering from attacks of gout,
which compelled him to give up his private practice and to
live exclusively upon the scant income which he derived
from the small fortune (80,000 francs—$16,000) that represented
his savings from a practice that had apparently been
quite successful. His death occurred from cerebral apoplexy
on November 23, 1776, when he was not quite fifty-four
years old.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bordeu did not live to see the ultimate triumph of his
ideas with regard to the true nature of the secretions supplied
by glands. The careful consideration of what this
author has written upon the applications of the accessory
sciences (chemistry and mechanics) to physiology should
put us on our guard, says Richerand, against drawing incorrect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>conclusions with reference to the nature of vital
processes.</p>

<p>BICHAT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Marie François-Xavier Bichat</span> was born on November
11, 1771, at Thoirette, France, in the Department of the
Jura. His father, who was a practicing physician at the
neighboring town of Poncin, and who at the same time held
the office of mayor, was a man of considerable cultivation.
Cherishing, as he did, the hope that his son might eventually
adopt medicine as his vocation, he planned the latter’s education
with special reference to this possibility; and, as
medicine proved to be the very vocation which the son preferred,
all this well-planned training counted as so much
valuable time gained. François, who showed himself to be
an apt scholar, made most satisfactory progress in all the
prescribed studies of early boyhood, and after passing
creditably through the regular course of the <i>Collège de
Nantua</i>, a thriving town among the western foot-hills of
the Jura range of mountains, he began the study of medicine
at Lyons, in 1791. At first he devoted himself almost
exclusively to anatomy and surgery. Marc-Antoine Petit,
the celebrated surgeon of the Hôtel-Dieu of Lyons, was his
teacher in these branches of medical science, and from the
very first took special pains to aid his pupil in his studies
in every possible manner. François manifested an unusual
degree of interest in anatomy, a branch of medical science
to which at that period only those who had the intention of
practicing surgery paid any attention; and in addition he
developed, almost at the very start, a strong disposition to
learn the precise purpose of each tissue and organ as it was
encountered in the course of his dissections. In other
words, François-Xavier Bichat was already, at the early age
of twenty, making original investigations in the department
of physiology. This fact, says his biographer, should
be classed as something very remarkable, for, at the period
which we are now considering, practically not one of the
students of medicine was giving any thought except to the
wonderful surgical work that had been accomplished, a few
years earlier, by the famous Parisian surgeon, J. L. Petit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>(1674–1750), by F. de Lapeyronie of Montpellier (1678–1747),
by S. F. Morand of Paris (1697–1793), by the famous
lithotomist, Frère Côme (1703–1781), of whose achievements
I gave a brief account in “The Growth of Medicine,”
and by another celebrated teacher of surgery in Paris, viz.,
Pierre-Joseph Desault, who, during the period which we
are now considering occupied by far the most conspicuous
position among the men classed as healers of disease, and
who, by the very prominence of his position, compelled
almost everybody who took any interest in medicine to keep
their eyes riveted on him. These and other circumstances
that happened to exist at that period strongly favored
among the younger men a leaning toward the career of
surgeon. One of these favoring circumstances was the need
of army surgeons, for France was in the throes of the
French Revolution. It was therefore not strange that at
first Bichat devoted the greater part of his time and thought
to the fundamental work of a surgeon’s training. A little
later he accepted a subordinate position at the Hôtel-Dieu
of Lyons, under Marc-Antoine Petit, the head surgeon of
that great hospital. Favored in every legitimate way by
this eminent and most kindly surgeon, young Bichat made
rapid progress. But there arrived a time, shortly after the
siege of Lyons, when it was no longer safe for a young man
to remain in Lyons, and so Bichat was forced to flee to
Paris. There he joined the crowd of students who were
regularly following the practical instruction given by
Desault.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was at that time an established custom in the medical
school for certain pupils, who had been previously selected
for this work, to read (in turn) to the assembled group of
students, just before the arrival of the attending surgeon,
a <i>résumé</i> of the previous day’s lecture. In this way the man
whose turn it was to read the <i>résumé</i> which he had prepared,
secured a most valuable bit of training, and those
who simply listened were afforded an excellent opportunity
for refreshing their memories with regard to the lecture of
the previous day. On these occasions the First Assistant
was always present and was therefore in a position to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>report to his Chief just how successfully each reader of
such a review had performed the duty assigned to him. At
one of his lectures Desault entered more elaborately than
usual into a description of his manner of treating fracture
of the clavicle, demonstrating among other things the
proper manner of applying what has since become known
as “Desault’s bandage.” The student who had been
assigned to the duty of preparing a <i>résumé</i> of that day’s
lecture happened to be absent on that particular occasion,
and so the First Assistant asked the members of the class
whether perhaps one of their number would be willing to
act as a substitute. Bichat volunteered his services, and
he thereupon prepared a <i>résumé</i> which, when read on the
following day, proved to be so clearly expressed and covered
the ground so thoroughly that the class, after listening to it
in profound silence, expressed its approval by the most
pronounced applause. When Desault was told by his First
Assistant, Manouty, of what had happened he was very
impatient to make Bichat’s acquaintance; and, after he had
talked with the latter for a short time, he became so impressed
with the extent of the knowledge which he had
already acquired, with his earnestness of purpose, and with
his amiability of character, that he did not hesitate to invite
him to become one of his household. Indeed, the favorable
impression which Bichat made upon him led him promptly
to decide that, if nothing happened later to change the
impression which he had first received, he would do all in
his power to make this young man his successor.</p>

<p class='c007'>This kindly reception on the part of his honored preceptor
made a deep and most cheering impression on Bichat
and stimulated him to put forth his best powers to justify
the confidence shown by Desault. At the latter’s request
he took charge of part of Desault’s private practice, and he
also accepted the position of Hospital Attending Physician
to the Outside Poor. Furthermore, he acted as Desault’s
corresponding secretary, answering for him all the requests
for advice that came to him from every district of France.
Then, in addition, he assisted him in all his operations in
private practice. Finally, as if he were not already burdened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to the limit of his strength with all this mass of work,
he not infrequently spent a portion of the night in aiding
Desault to solve various problems in experimental surgery,
problems relating chiefly to diseases of the bones. Whenever
a lull occurred in this series of engrossing labors he
devoted all the available time to the performance of operations
upon the cadaver and to experiments in relation to
physiological problems that suggested themselves to his
own mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already as early as in 1797—that is, when he was twenty-six
years of age—Bichat gave his first course in anatomy.
The room in which the instruction was given was quite
small, for he was confident that only a few pupils would feel
disposed to subscribe for such a course, and in addition no
provision for laboratory work had been made. At first, the
teaching was limited to simple demonstrations, but very
soon discussions with regard to physiological questions
began to occupy some of the time of the sessions. Finally,
Bichat found it desirable now and then to carry out experiments
on living animals, in order to verify certain seemingly
well-known facts and also to determine the exact
points at which new investigations should be instituted.
When this first course in anatomy came to an end he surprised
his friends by beginning a course on operative surgery.
“I wish,” he remarked to one of his intimates, “to
demonstrate that even a young man may be quite as capable
as one of mature age, to operate with the requisite degree
of precision.” The course proved a great success, and
demonstrated perfectly the truth of his statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under all this strain upon his vital energy, it soon began
to be apparent that Bichat’s health was giving way, and it
was not long before a pulmonary or bronchial hemorrhage
forced him to desist from his work. At one time, indeed,
his physical condition was such as to make his friends fear
for his life. In the course of a few months, however, he
seemed to regain his health; and then he forthwith made
arrangements for a much more complete course in anatomy
than that which he had carried through so successfully the
year before. A laboratory provided with accommodations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>for eighty dissectors was constructed, and, before the
course began, every one of these eighty seats was engaged.
(This was in 1798.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a great source of amazement to his friends—and
it continues to be a great source of amazement to the physicians
of the present day—how Bichat managed to accomplish
successfully such a number of things as he, at this
early period of his life and with a decidedly precarious
state of health, had taken in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing was now very noticeable, namely, that he was
devoting a much larger part of his time and attention to
experimental physiology—that is, to the phenomena and
the laws of life—than he had hitherto done to anatomy.
After he had finished the work which belonged properly to
the daylight hours he devoted no small portion of the nighttime
to the work of revising the writings of his beloved
teacher and friend, Desault.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the anatomical structures about which almost
nothing was known toward the end of the eighteenth century,
but of which the structure and functions were fully
exposed to light by Bichat’s labors, the synovial membranes
deserve to receive the very first mention. His researches
concerning these membranes were first made known in the
public lectures which he was giving at that time to the
medical students, but they did not appear in print until a
later date, viz., in the second volume of the “<i>Recueil de la
Société Médicale d’Émulation</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At a somewhat later period Bichat abandoned all further
attempts to cultivate either the knowledge or the practice
of surgery, and concentrated all his efforts upon the extension
of our knowledge of the principles of physiology. He
made very careful researches into the nature and functions
of serous membranes, and published the results of his
labors in a volume which met with great favor at the hands
of a large part of the medical profession, and yet at the
same time brought out strong manifestations of envy on the
part of other physicians. As Buisson justly remarks, these
manifestations of envy furnished the very best sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>proof that Bichat, who paid no attention whatever to these
criticisms, had done his work remarkably well.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the same year (1800) Bichat published a third treatise,
under the title “<i>Recherches Physiologiques sur la Vie et la
Mort</i>.” (A later edition appeared in 1805.)</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, as Bichat was descending the main staircase of
Hôtel-Dieu, his foot slipped and he fell in such a manner as
to strike his head with considerable force against one of the
steps. When somebody came to his assistance it was found
that he was unconscious. In a short time, however, consciousness
returned, and Bichat was able, though with some
difficulty, to regain his home. On the following day he suffered
from a severe headache, but insisted, nevertheless, on
making a few professional calls. The exhaustion which he
felt after making these visits compelled him to take to his
bed as soon as he reached his residence. Death took place
on the fourteenth day after the occurrence of the accident;
that is, on July 22, 1802.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bonaparte, who was at that time First Consul of the
French Republic, gave orders, upon hearing the news of
Bichat’s death, that a monument should be erected in the
vestibule of Hôtel-Dieu to commemorate the distinguished
services rendered to humanity in that institution by Desault
and Bichat. The following is the inscription which it
bears:—</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Ce marbre dédié a la Mémoire des Citoyens Desault et Bichat a
été posé pour attester la reconnaissance de leur contemporains,
pour les services qu’ils ont rendus, le premier à la Chirurgie Française
dont il est le restaurateur, le second à la Médecine qu’il a
enrichée de plusieurs ouvrages utiles, et dont il eût aggrandi le
domaine si l’impitoyable mort ne l’eût frappé dans sa 31me année.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a></i></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Aside from his scientific attainments and from his untiring
zeal in prosecuting his researches in anatomy and
physiology, Bichat possessed certain traits of character
which caused him to be greatly beloved by his pupils. He
was of a very kindly disposition, and it was not an easy
matter to excite him to anger or even to cause him to show
impatience.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'>The first feeble beginnings of experimental physiology
are to be credited to the Swiss physician, Albrecht von
Haller, whose death occurred in 1777. Then followed, a few
years later, the more serious efforts that were made in the
same field of scientific inquiry by John Hunter, of England.
The real birth of this new science, however, took place in
France, under the fostering care of Lavoisier, Bichat,
Magendie and others. The establishment in Paris, by
Bichat, of a large laboratory where such research work
could be carried on advantageously, constituted the first act
in the creation of an organized experimental physiology.
Several years later (1867), Claude Bernard induced Monsieur
Duruy, who was at that time Minister of Public
Instruction in France, to establish at the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i>
a laboratory where general physiology might be studied
experimentally.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>TYPES OF FRENCH PHYSICIANS WHO FLOURISHED
ABOUT THE TIME OF THE REIGN OF
TERROR</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Louis-Guillaume Lemonnier</span>, member of the Academy
of the Sciences and First Physician of the King (Louis
XV. and also Louis XVI.), was born at Paris, June 27,
1717. His father and his brother were both of them members
of the Academy, the former in his character of Professor
of Physics at Harcourt, and the latter as one of the
most celebrated astronomers of France. At the age of
twenty-two he was sent (1739), with Carsini de Thury and
Lacaille, to the south of France to extend the meridian of
the Observatory of Paris, the task of making scientific
observations along the route followed by his superior associates
being specially assigned to him. He noted the existence
of mines of ochre, coal, iron, antimony and amethysts
in Auvergne, of mineral waters in Mont-d’Or, and of mines
of iron in Roussillon. He also made analyses of the mineral
waters of Barèges, and determined the poisonous nature of
certain species of mushrooms. In the same year he received
the appointment of Physician to the Hospital at St. Germain-en-Laye,
near Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this period of his career Lemonnier made the
acquaintance of an expert floral gardener by the name of
Richard, and in his company soon developed a keen interest
in flowers and garden plants. The Duke of Ayen, who was
one of the King’s favorites and well known for his love of
flowers as well as for his boldness of speech in telling the
truth to the royal household, made frequent visits to Richard’s
garden and in this way acquired a friendship for
Lemonnier, who entertained him greatly with his talks
about botanical matters and about the cultivation of trees.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>As a result the Duke’s extensive park in time became the
home of rare plants and numerous species of noble trees,
many of which were still flourishing during Cuvier’s time.
After a while Louis XV. was induced by the Duke to accompany
him on some of his visits to Richard’s garden, and on
one of these occasions the King asked that Lemonnier
should be introduced to him, as he wished to become
acquainted with the man who had so successfully aided the
Duke in establishing an attractive botanical garden. At
this first interview Lemonnier made a most favorable impression
upon the King,—so favorable, indeed, that the
latter, after a few further interviews had taken place,
placed this physician and enthusiastic botanist in charge of
the botanical garden at the Trianon, in Versailles; and not
long afterward he appointed him his First Physician, a
position which carried with it a liberal salary. Cuvier, in
accounting for the enthusiastic love for botany which
develops in certain men, makes the following remarks:—</p>

<p class='c017'>In our dealing with plants nothing of a painful nature is encountered;
no sad images are ever presented to our eyes; there is
absolutely nothing to recall to our minds our passions, our disappointments,
our misfortunes; love is never associated with jealousy,
beauty exists without vanity, force is never accompanied by
tyranny, and death takes place without agony; in brief, there is
nothing to remind one of the human species.</p>

<p class='c019'>The only use that Lemonnier made of his pleasant relationship
with the King was to secure his sanction of the
plan of sending competent botanists to different parts of
the globe with instructions to bring or send back rare
plants, first to the Trianon garden at Versailles and, after
the death of Louis XV. (in 1774), to the Jardin du Roi
(Jardin des Plantes) at Paris. In accordance with this
scheme men were despatched to Persia, to the coasts and
islands of the Mediterranean, to the banks of the Euphrates,
to Cayenne in South America, to the Atlas Mountains,
to Liban, to China and to the East Indies.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As Lemonnier was not in the habit of publishing anything
on botanical subjects, he was comparatively unknown to the
public. Were it not for this fact, says Cuvier, he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>easily have taken rank among the most celebrated botanists
of France. When his friends chided him for having
neglected to avail himself of this mode of obtaining well-earned
recognition he replied that the time spent in
instructing others is lost so far as his own self-instruction
is concerned. Furthermore, he was timid in regard to publishing.
“There is sure to be a great deal of unjust criticism
about anything a man may write, and I cannot easily
bear such injustice. I therefore prefer to keep silence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the death of Louis XV. Lemonnier lost his position
of First Physician to the King and he was not reappointed
by Louis XVI. until 1788. Thus, during a period of fourteen
years, he was deprived of the large salary which is
attached to that position, and was obliged to live upon the
relatively small income which he derived from private practice.
During the continuance of his official connection with
the Court he invariably refused to accept any fees from
those individuals who belonged to the Court circle but yet
held no official position. On the other hand, he was most
generous in giving the best of his service, gratis, to the poor.
As a consequence, his popularity among the lower classes
was very great. He reaped the reward for this disinterestedness
on the occasion when the mob, in 1792, invaded
Versailles and carried off the King and Marie Antoinette to
Paris. As soon as the palace was vacated Lemonnier
sought safety in one of the small pavilions in the adjoining
park; but the rabble broke into the building and were
carrying off Lemonnier as a prisoner when suddenly a man,
who seemed to be one of the leaders of the mob, stepped out
from the crowd and ordered the physician to follow him.
Thus Lemonnier was conducted to his room in the Luxembourg
palace in Paris, all the time under the guidance of
this strange, rough-looking man, who nevertheless, when
they arrived at the Luxembourg, acknowledged to the doctor
that he intended, from the very first, to save his life if he
possibly could, because he was sure, “from the kindly and
venerable expression of his countenance, that he could not
possibly have had anything to do with the abuses of which
the rabble complained so bitterly.” Thus was Lemonnier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>rewarded for all his past services to the poor of Paris and
Versailles.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last years of his life—he was eighty-two years
old when he died—he enjoyed, in the quiet society of his
former friends, who stood by him faithfully to the end, what
he termed the happiest years of his life.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Charles Louis Dumas</span>, born at Lyons, France, on
February 8, 1765, was the son of a practicing surgeon. At
the age of seventeen he began the study of medicine at
Montpellier, Barthez and Grimaud being at that time the
most distinguished members of the Medical Faculty of that
university. From the very first he manifested a keen interest
in his studies. In 1785 he received the degree of Doctor
of Medicine, the title of his graduating thesis being: “An
Essay on Life, or the Vital Faculties.” In 1787 he visited
Paris, and during the following two years devoted his attention
chiefly to chemistry and to the study of human
anatomy. It was during this period that he became warmly
attached to Vicq-d’Azyr.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1790 he returned to Montpellier and took part in a
competition for the chair of surgery left vacant by the
death of Sabatier. Although the judges decided in favor of
another competitor they were most favorably impressed
with the talents which Dumas exhibited. A year later, upon
the death of Barthélemy Vigaroux, Dumas accepted the
position of Vice-Professor of Surgery in the same university,
but, owing to the political troubles which developed
at this time in Lyons, he was obliged to resign his chair at
the end of one year and return to his native city. After
the termination of the siege of Lyons he was expelled from
the city, narrowly escaping with his life. In 1793 all teaching
of medicine at the University of Montpellier ceased,
and two years later a new school of medicine was organized,
and the duty of teaching anatomy and physiology was
assigned to Dumas. In 1798 he was chosen President of the
school and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier.
He died on March 28, 1813, at the early age of forty-seven.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more important of the treatises written and published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>by Dumas are the following:—“<i>Principes de Physiologie</i>,”
Paris, 1800–1803, 4 vols., and “<i>Doctrine Générale
des Maladies Chroniques</i>, etc.,” Montpellier, 1812, and a
second edition (2 vols.) in 1824.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis</span> was born June 5, 1757,
at the village of Conac, in the Department of Corrèze,
France. During his early youth he gave no evidence
whatever of possessing an inclination to study, but at the
age of fourteen he was taken to Paris, and then, for
the first time, he manifested great eagerness to acquire all
kinds of knowledge. After having completed his preliminary
course of literary training he accepted the position of
private secretary to Prince Massalsky, Bishop of Wilna,
and accompanied him on his return to Poland. A residence
of two years in that distracted country convinced him, however,
that he had better return to France and seek there
for an opening to some useful career. Accordingly he went
to Paris, and, upon learning that a prize for a French translation,
in verse, of a part of Homer’s Iliad had been offered
by the <i>Académie Française</i>, he devoted all his time and
energy to the writing of such a translation. Richerand,
from whose eulogy on Cabanis I have derived most of the
information furnished in the present sketch, does not state
whether these efforts were or were not rewarded by the
capture of the coveted prize. His account, however, makes
it perfectly clear that Cabanis was an enthusiastic admirer
of the poetry of Homer and that he would gladly have
devoted his life to the cultivation of literature if he had not,
at the same time, been deeply impressed with the idea that
a good citizen should devote a large share of his time and
his talents to things of real use to his fellow men and to his
native or adopted country. Accordingly, in due course of
time, he set aside his purely literary employment and began
in earnest the study of medicine, to which vocation he now
transferred his allegiance with all the ardor of which he
was capable. Hippocrates, whose accurate descriptions of
disease and whose high standard of professional duty
excited his admiration as much as had the writings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Homer, furnished him with the first models that were to
serve as guides in his newly chosen career. To add to his
good fortune he had the privilege of studying medicine
under the guidance of Dubreuil, a teacher of the very highest
order, a philosopher, and a man of whom the pupil
always spoke in strong terms of admiration and affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>After taking his doctor’s degree in 1784 Cabanis devoted
all his energies, during the few years which elapsed between
this event and the breaking out of the French Revolution,
to the practice of his profession. Aside from these duties
he accepted only one official responsibility, viz., that of
Administrator of the Hospitals of Paris, and this duty he
performed with entire success. It is a fact worth noting
that he was one of Mirabeau’s intimate friends, and he
believed thoroughly in the principles of the French Revolution,
but he did not approve of the excesses which characterized
its progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some idea of the importance of the position which
Cabanis held in the esteem of his associates in the Parisian
world of science and politics may be gained from the following
statements:—Early in his career he was introduced by
Turgot, the former Controller-General, to Madame Helvétius,
the widow of the well-known <i>littérateur</i>, Claude
Adrien Helvétius, and a woman whose weekly receptions
(<i>salons</i>) brought together at frequent intervals some of the
most famous men at that time residing in Paris. Thus he
became acquainted with Franklin and Jefferson, of the
United States, as well as with Diderot and d’Alembert, the
famous writers connected with the French Encyclopædia.
He was also presented to Voltaire, who received him in the
most kindly manner. Although from 1789 to the end of his
life he published a number of useful pamphlets on different
topics connected with public affairs and especially with
public charitable institutions and undertakings, he rarely
permitted his name to appear as the author of such essays.
In 1799, when the Consulate was entrusted with the government
of France, Cabanis accepted a seat in the Senate and
took an active interest in public questions. During the last
three years of his life the increasingly bad state of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>health did not permit him to do much work of any kind; and
finally, on May 6, 1808, an attack of cerebral apoplexy put
an end to his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two most important works published by Cabanis are
the following:—“<i>Rapports du Physique et du Moral de
l’Homme</i>,” Paris, 1802 (2d edition in 1805); and “<i>Du
Degré de Certitude de la Médecine</i>,” Paris, 1797 (3d edition
in 1819).</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Félix Vicq-d’Azyr</span>, who was born in 1748, was distinguished
chiefly as an anatomist and physiologist, and
also as a writer on scientific topics. The Faculty of Paris,
not being pleased with his rapid advance in popular favor,
refused to allow him the privilege of lecturing in their
anatomical theatre. Then Antoine Petit, who was at that
time Professor of Anatomy at the “<i>Jardin du Roi</i>,”—an
institution which was located in what is now known as the
Jardin des Plantes and was in a limited sense a rival of
the <i>École de Médecine</i>,—befriended him and did everything
in his power to make him successor to himself in the Chair
of Anatomy. In this attempt, however, Petit failed, for
Portal, whose candidacy was backed by the more influential
Buffon, eventually received the appointment. Just at this
juncture of affairs Vicq-d’Azyr met with a stroke of good
luck. A niece of the celebrated naturalist, Daubenton, who
spent a large part of his long life in work connected with
the Jardin du Roi, happened one day to have a fainting fit
just as she was passing in front of Vicq-d’Azyr’s residence.
This physician, who chanced to be at home when the fainting
occurred, did everything in his power to restore the
lady to consciousness; and in this he was perfectly successful.
In fact, not many months elapsed before they were
married; and from this time forward Daubenton did everything
in his power to advance Vicq-d’Azyr’s career as a
scientist. He aided him, for example, in procuring a great
variety of foreign animals which the latter needed for his
researches in comparative anatomy; and, in addition, he
promoted his candidacy for membership in the <i>Académie
des Sciences</i>, to which organization he received an election
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>in 1774. Soon afterward he gained the esteem and friendship
of Lassonne, the First Physician of the King, and
through his influence Vicq-d’Azyr was commissioned to
carry assistance to the people living in certain districts of
France where an epidemic disease was raging. Later, Lassonne
aided him in organizing the <i>Société Royale de Médecine</i>,
the function of which was to perfect all the departments
of medical activity. Eventually Vicq-d’Azyr was
made <i>Secrétaire Perpetuel</i> of this society. The Faculty, as
had happened before under similar circumstances, showed
itself jealous of this new organization, and systematically
did all in its power to undermine the influence of Vicq-d’Azyr,
whom it recognized as the guiding spirit of the
scheme. Despite these malicious efforts the public at
large, recognizing their origin and the mean spirit of jealousy
which prompted them, lost no opportunity of bestowing
praise upon Vicq-d’Azyr. In 1788 the <i>Académie Française</i>
chose him as Buffon’s successor, and in 1789 he
succeeded Lassonne as the First Physician of the Queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vicq-d’Azyr’s purely scientific writings are very numerous
and of marked importance. They cover a wide extent
of subjects—medicine, anatomy (both human and comparative),
and the veterinary art. His death occurred on June
25, 1794, from some acute affection of the chest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The treatises and memoirs which he wrote were first published
separately at different dates, but in 1805 a fairly
complete collection was published at Paris by Moreau.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jean-Noel Hallé</span>, born at Paris, France, toward the end
of the eighteenth century, was one of the most distinguished
physicians of that period. Cuvier, the famous naturalist
and the author of the biography upon which the
present sketch is based, makes the following statement:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Those physicians who can steer their way successfully through
such a maze of difficulties as existed during the French Revolution,
and who at the same time can inspire their patients with a feeling
of entire confidence in their ability to bring them safely back to
health, deserve our highest admiration and respect. But when we
wish, in giving an account of a physician of this calibre, to furnish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>clear proofs of the truth of what we say, we find it exceedingly
difficult to produce the necessary evidence. The names of three
such men occur to me, viz., Hallé, Corvisart and Pinel.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the further course of his narrative Cuvier states that,
in his charitable gifts to the poor, Hallé studiously concealed
from them the source of the aid which they received.
Many a patient, he adds, upon his recovery from the attack
for which the doctor had treated him, was astonished to
find that all the expenses incurred during his illness had in
some mysterious manner been defrayed. “How rarely
indeed,” says Cuvier, “does one learn of such a perfect
carrying out of the injunction: ‘Let not thy right hand
know what thy left hand doeth.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>About the year 1794 Hallé’s father and his grandfather
were made members of the Order of Saint-Michael, an
honor which conferred nobility not only upon them but also
upon himself. Unfortunately for the doctor, who was residing
in Paris at the time, this patent of nobility made him
subject to the new law which had been passed by the Convention,
and which drove into exile all members of the
nobility. An exception, however, was made in his case
because he held the office of Physician to the Poor,
and also—doubtless—because he was universally known
throughout Paris to be a staunch friend of the poor. Having
thus received permission to remain in the capital Hallé
at once bethought himself how he might aid those unfortunates
who were confined in prison. He was permitted, for
example, to visit Malesherbes, Minister Turbot’s associate,
who was awaiting his death by the guillotine. Not only
was he thus enabled to speak words of comfort to the unfortunate
prisoner, but he received from him such farewell
messages for his distressed family and friends as he desired
to send. Hallé was also one of those friends of Lavoisier
who interfered actively, but in vain, to save his life from
the executioner’s block. Those were terrible times and it
required great courage to do what Hallé did in behalf of
these innocent victims of the murderous Jacobins.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourcroy, the celebrated chemist and naturalist, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>authorized by the Convention in 1794 and 1795 to organize
a new <i>École de Médecine</i>, to take the place of the one which
the rabble had destroyed in 1783, appointed Hallé Professor
of Medical Physics and Hygiene. Then, later still (1796),
Corvisart, who by that time was in the full exercise of his
functions as medical adviser to Bonaparte,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> appointed Hallé
his associate in the professorship at the Collège de France.
Shortly afterward he gave up the Chair entirely to Hallé.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the years 1800 and 1812 Hallé, more than any
other French physician, exerted his influence—and with
decided success—in overcoming the remaining opposition to
vaccination, not only in France but also in Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Corvisart left to Hallé in his will the portrait of Stoll,
the distinguished Vienna professor, and added a memorandum
to the effect that he made this gift because he esteemed
Hallé more highly than he did any other physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many anecdotes have been told concerning the peculiarities
of Hallé in his dealings with patients. The following
two may perhaps prove of interest to my readers:—If, for
example, the patient happened to be an artist, Hallé refused
to accept a fee from him; and, when asked why he did this,
he replied: “Because from way back I belong to a family of
artists.” Then, in the second place, he was not willing to
accept fees from ecclesiastics. “If they have only just
enough to live upon, they should not be subjected to any
diminution of that small stipend. On the other hand, if
they have more than is absolutely necessary for their legitimate
living expenses, this excess belongs to the poor.” The
following anecdote is told of one of his experiences:—</p>

<p class='c017'>One day, when he returned to his office, worn out with a hard
day’s practice, he was told that a lady was waiting to consult him.
“Ask her,” he said to the attendant, “kindly to consult some other
physician, as I am too tired to see her.” She sent back word that
she had not the courage to do this, as she was not able to pay for
the services of this other physician. “If that is the case,” Hallé
promptly replied, “tell her I will see her.” To himself he said:
“I have no right to send her away.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Hallé’s death occurred on February 11, 1822. Laënnec
succeeded him at the Collège de France.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gaspard Laurent Bayle</span> was born on August 18, 1774, at
the village of Vernet in the Department of the Basses-Alps.
The country in this part of France is very picturesque but
not at all fertile; lofty mountains surround it on all sides.
At an early age Gaspard manifested a high degree of intelligence
and a strong inclination to study natural phenomena.
He was barely ten years old when he began making
a collection of insects, and he even went so far as to give
names to the individual species. He was only twelve years
old when he was sent to the High School of Embrun; and in
this institution he made such advances in his studies that
the principal, Father Rossignol, a Jesuit, looked upon him
as one of the most promising of the pupils under his charge;
more than this, he felt a strong affection for the boy. As
the curriculum of the school studies did not include mathematics
and natural history Father Rossignol took particular
pains to furnish Gaspard with instruction in these
branches of knowledge. The warm friendship which thus
developed between the scholar and his instructor, continued
unbroken up to the time of the latter’s death in 1813.</p>

<p class='c007'>Laboring under the impression that it was his duty to
become a priest Gaspard enrolled his name at the theological
seminary in 1790, and devoted the following year to the
study of philosophy and theology; but, after the lapse of a
certain length of time, doubts began to enter his mind as to
the wisdom of the choice which he had made, and accordingly,
after consultation with his father and older brother,
both of whom were lawyers, he abandoned the study of
theology and entered his brother’s law office.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1793, when the storms of the French Revolution had
reached their acme of violence, young Bayle, who was then
only nineteen years old, attended a political meeting at
Embrun and made such a stirring appeal to the mountaineers
there assembled, in regard to their duty as Republicans,
that he completely won their confidence, and was
accordingly chosen to represent them at the approaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>reception of the Proconsuls Barras and Fréron, who had
been sent by the Convention to persuade the inhabitants of
that district to carry out the violent measures which had
been planned against the city of Digne. The Proconsuls,
who in the meantime had arrived at Digne, quickly discovered
that public sentiment was not in favor of the measures
advocated by the Convention; and accordingly, in the
fear that an uprising of the citizens might imperil their
own lives, they promptly fled from that city; but, before
leaving, they made arrangements for the arrest of the
young orator who had produced such a strongly antagonistic
impression upon the people. As soon as Bayle’s father
and brother had learned these facts they quickly took all
the steps necessary for secretly getting Gaspard out of
Digne and sending him as speedily as possible to Montpellier,
where—by enrolling himself among the students of
Medicine—they believed that he might reasonably expect
to escape the clutches of Barras and Fréron. These measures
proved successful, and thus Bayle’s life was saved and
his attention diverted from the Law to Medicine, a career
in which he was destined to gain great credit.</p>

<p class='c007'>After spending three years at Montpellier Bayle was
sent, as an <i>Officier de Santé</i>, to serve at a military hospital
temporarily established at Nice, in the south of France.
And here let me remark, parenthetically, that this title
should not be translated by the corresponding English term
“Health Officer.” In 1795 a new type of medical school was
established in France, the object of this innovation being
to provide a class of practitioners who could meet all the
ordinary medical needs of the peasants at a charge considerably
less than that demanded by the graduates of the
high schools. The course in these new schools covered a
period of only two years, and the graduates were classed as
“<i>Officiers de Santé</i>.”</p>

<p>GASPARD LAURENT BAYLE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As Bayle’s duties here at Nice were not very exacting he
divided the time which he had at his disposal between the
bedside observation of cases of actual disease and the study
of treatises relating to pathology. In 1798 he went to Paris
and followed several courses of instruction, more particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>that given by Corvisart on pathological anatomy. In
1799, at a competitive examination, he won the position of
Assistant in Anatomy, and from that time forward he
devoted a large part of his time to the work of making post-mortem
examinations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1802 Bayle received his degree of Doctor of Medicine.
The thesis which he wrote on this occasion created a great
sensation, partly because it described an entirely new form
of gangrene, and even more on account of the philosophic
manner in which he defended all his statements when called
upon to do so at the public cross-examination which, at all
the foreign universities, commonly precedes the bestowal
of the degree upon the candidate. Two of Bayle’s friends
who were present on this occasion, secured shorthand notes
of the discussion that took place between the candidate and
the professors (Petit-Radel, Pinel, Alphonse Leroy and
Percy) whose duty it was to question him with regard to
the views put forward in the thesis. The report based upon
these shorthand notes covers nine printed pages of the
biographic sketch which lies before me, and is not—as will
readily be appreciated by my readers—suitable for reproduction
here in its entirety; nor would a digest of such a
report serve any useful purpose. The most that seems to
me permissible under the circumstances is to furnish here
two or three brief extracts, from a perusal of which it will
be possible to form at least some idea of the character of
this cross-examination. It should be stated, however, by
way of preface, that Professor Petit-Radel had, just before
the discussion began, raised objections to Bayle’s failure,
in his thesis, to include in his list of inflammatory affections
“the whitish engorgements observed at times in different
organs”; and he then added the following remark: “You
are not disposed, I assume, to recognize the existence of
Boerhaave’s ‘white inflammation.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>(Here follows the first part of the stenographic report of
the cross-examination.)</p>

<p class='c017'>BAYLE: “If in the affection to which you refer the swelling is
accompanied by pain, and if it terminates by undergoing resolution
or by suppuration, then I should say that it bore some relationship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>to inflammation; but if there is neither redness, pain, fever, nor
suppuration, I should declare that it possesses none of the characters
which distinguish inflammatory affections, and that consequently
this so-called ‘white inflammation’ should be considered by
us as something imaginary. At the same time I should not like to
have anybody get the impression, from what I have said, that I
deny the existence of such things as white tumors or swellings,
indolent in character, and either elastic or permitting the pressure
of a finger to leave the mark called ‘pitting’; I simply wish to
emphasize the fact that these affections do not manifest any of the
characteristics of an inflammatory disturbance.”</p>

<p class='c018'>PETIT-RADEL: “Do you not believe that there exist certain
kinds of humors which possess the power of giving rise to a white
variety of inflammation?”</p>

<p class='c018'>BAYLE: “As I do not know what this ‘white inflammation’
really is, you must not expect me to entertain a clear idea of what
its immediate causes are; and even if I were personally familiar
with this type of ‘inflammation,’ it is more than likely that I would
wander far from the truth if I were to attempt to define the particular
kind of humor which causes this affection. It is easy to say
that bile, or some other humor that possesses a sufficiently acrid
character, is the exciting cause; and then I might print what I have
to say on the subject in a beautiful book.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a> But of what use are all
these hypothetical deductions; why resort to pure operations of the
imagination when we seek to explain natural phenomena? Is it
not better to say simply ‘I do not know’ than to erect a pompous
edifice on a foundation of moving sand?”</p>

<p class='c018'>PETIT-RADEL: “Very well, let us speak now of the treatment
which you recommend. Was it a wise thing to prescribe bleeding
and purgatives in the treatment of the gangrenous pustule which
you describe in your thesis?” etc.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The remainder of the stenographic report is fully as
interesting as the first part, but I do not feel warranted in
omitting equally important text in order to find room for
the report in its entirety. I will simply state that, before
the cross-examination was completed, Bayle had boldly
expressed the opinion that “there is nothing more harmful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>to the advance of practical medicine than the cultivation of
the spirit of system.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long after Bayle received his degree of M.D. he succeeded
in obtaining, as the result of a competitive examination,
one of the two positions of House Physician (“<i>elève
interne</i>”) which existed at La Charité Hospital; and here,
having at his disposal an extraordinary amount of valuable
material both clinical and pathological, and being aided by
the experienced guidance of Corvisart and Dumangin, he enjoyed
for about two years the most extensive opportunity
for self-culture which it is possible for a young physician—Bayle
was only twenty-eight in 1802—to have placed at his
disposal. Being very industrious and also extremely ambitious
to excel he accumulated a great stock of knowledge
concerning the different forms of disease to which human
beings are subject. Not only did he store this knowledge
up in the chambers of his mind, but he also kept written
records of everything that seemed to possess value, for use
at a later period of his life. This fact should be remembered,
for those who have had occasion to consult the
numerous treatises which Bayle has published, cannot
have failed to wonder that he should have been able to furnish
so many and so complete histories of cases that came
under his personal observation. But alas! he failed to
realize that this sort of work was sapping his strength, and
he also seemed to ignore the fact that he was carrying
within himself the seeds of a pulmonary disease which was
sure sooner or later to put an end to his labors. Already as
early as in August, 1804, he was seized with such a violent
nostalgia, such an irresistible longing for his beloved mountains,
that he was obliged to drop all work at <i>La Charité</i>
and return to his home in the south of France. In addition
to the nostalgia there were loss of flesh, insomnia and a
sense of oppression in the chest. This change of scene, air
and occupation proved rapidly beneficial, for, at the end
of fifteen days, he felt much stronger and was able to sleep
much more soundly than for many previous weeks. His
morale, too, was markedly improved; his hunger for mountain
scenery and air was now satisfied. Then, for several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>years after his return to Paris, he remained in comparatively
good health, and was able to attend to an enormous
amount of hospital and private practice, in addition to
literary work. But in 1813 the threatening chest symptoms
again compelled him to visit his beloved Alps and to spend
several months with his wife and children in their mountain
home. This time, however, the improvement in his health
was much less pronounced than it was in 1804, and very
soon he found that he would have to abandon all active
work. His death took place on May 11, 1816, at the early
age of forty-two.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the statement of Bayle’s biographer it was
the unanimous opinion of all the physicians who had come
in frequent contact with him during his professional career,
especially in the course of his official work at <i>La Charité</i>,
that no physician of equally varied and great attainments
had previously been seen in Paris. Professors Chomel and
Cayol, and the famous Laënnec maintained that this was
not too great praise to bestow upon Bayle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of his published writings I shall mention here only a few
of those which attained some celebrity, viz.: “<i>Remarques
sur les Tubercules</i>,” in the <i>Journal de Médecine, Chirurgie,
et Pharmacie</i>, tome 6, p. 1; tome 9, p. 427; and tome 10, p.
32.—“<i>Traité des Maladies Cancéreuses</i>,” 2 vols., Paris,
1833. (One of the earliest and certainly one of the most
elaborate treatises on this subject that is to be found in the
entire range of medical literature.)—“<i>Mémoire sur l’oedème
de la Glotte</i>,” in the <i>Dictionnaire des Sciences
Médicales</i>.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jean-Nicolas Corvisart</span>, who was born February 15,
1775, at Drécourt, a village in the Department of Ardennes,
N. E. France, was destined by his father to follow in his
footsteps, in the career of an attorney; but the son disliked
the work more and more as time went on. Finally, he
found an opportunity of attending one of the lectures of Antoine
Petit, who was one of the most eloquent lecturers on
anatomy in France during the eighteenth century. He was
completely fascinated by what he heard, and at once determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>that this was the only profession that he cared to
adopt. Accordingly, during the next few months he made a
practice of rising very early in the morning and finishing
the clerical work which had been assigned to him in his
father’s office; thus gaining time to attend the lectures of
Petit, Louis, Desault and Vicq-d’Azyr. When the father
discovered what his son had been doing he made up his mind
that it would be useless to make any further attempts to
keep him occupied with work calculated to fit him for the
career of an attorney. Accordingly he allowed him to follow
the regular course of studies prescribed for those who
intended to become physicians. At that early date (about
1770), however, the regular medical course of training
carried out by the Faculty of Medicine was most unsatisfactory.
For example, the so-called regular course of lectures
was not well adapted to form an adequate basis of
education for the student of medicine, and, in addition,
there was nothing that could be called clinical teaching. In
short, the student was obliged to pick up the knowledge
which he needed, in large measure by the exercise of his
own wits. But Corvisart was both eager to learn and very
persevering, and he possessed such a genius for picking
out as his guides the very men who were best fitted for imparting
useful knowledge, that he managed to make satisfactory
advances despite all these obstacles. The instructors
in whom he placed the greatest confidence were Desbois
de Rochefort, Head Physician of La Charité Hospital, and
Desault, Chief Surgeon of Hôtel-Dieu. These two men,
says Cuvier, were the most distinguished medical men of
their day in the art of curing disease. Desbois de Rochefort,
for example, was the first of the Parisian physicians to
give regular clinical instruction in the hospital with which
he was connected, and Corvisart followed this instruction
regularly throughout a period of several years. He was
also present at most of the post-mortem examinations which
took place during de Rochefort’s service; in fact, he took
the very deepest interest in this part of the work. A prick
of one of his fingers while he was dissecting caused an infection
which nearly cost him his life. It was on this occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>that Desault, by his skill and by his untiring efforts to control
the manifestations of the disease, rendered him
splendid service.</p>

<div id='i188'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>CORVISART<br /><br />(Copied from an old French print in the possession of the New York Academy of Medicine.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Under such persistent and intelligent training it was not
long before Corvisart was himself able to give courses of
instruction in anatomy and physiology,—courses which
rapidly became very popular with the students.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as dress was concerned, Molière succeeded in driving
out of fashion the gown and pointed bonnet which the
physicians of that day were still, in accordance with the
custom of centuries, wearing; but he failed to induce them
to abandon the wig which they were expected to wear when
engaged in actual service in the hospital wards. This practice
continued in force until Hallé and Corvisart both got
themselves into trouble by refusing to wear a wig. In the
case of Corvisart the following story is told:—A well-known
Paris lady (Madame Necker) had just founded a fine hospital
to which Corvisart hoped to be appointed the Physician-in-Chief.
When he first appeared in one of the wards in his
natural hair, the lady founder was much shocked, and declared
positively that she was not willing to assume the
responsibility of sanctioning any such novelty. Corvisart
remained firm in his resolution and the position was given
to another physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>Compensation for this disappointment, says Cuvier, came
to Corvisart soon afterward, in the following manner:—Père
Potentine, the Superior of the monks connected with
La Charité Hospital, had been struck with the faithful manner
in which Corvisart had cared for the sick under his
charge. So, when Desbois-Rochefort, the pioneer clinical
teacher in Paris, died in 1788, he quickly determined that he
would, if possible, secure for Corvisart the important position
which had just been vacated. His efforts proved successful,
and in a short time the new appointee was attracting
to La Charité a large number of students who were just as
appreciative of Corvisart’s clinical teachings as they had
been of the instruction given by his predecessor.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few years later still—in 1802—he was asked to see in
consultation Bonaparte, who was suffering from an acute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>pulmonary attack; and on this occasion he had the good fortune
not only to discover the real cause of the trouble but
also to recommend the measures which resulted in curing
the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Despite his great success, both as a teacher and as a
practitioner, Corvisart experienced his full share of professional
disappointments, and was, in consequence, often
very much depressed by them. He was wont to express in
very plain terms his dislike for those treatises in which the
author assigned to each disease a list of sharply defined
characteristics, and which caused the reader to believe that
the course which it pursued was invariably the same; which
spoke of disease, in short, in such a manner as to convey
to young men the impression that the science of medicine
was one of the physical sciences, and that both diseases and
the remedies to be employed might well be reduced to a
comparatively few forms. No such simplicity exists in
nature; the number of combinations is infinite, and each day
the combination is likely to be completely changed. The
numerous autopsies which he had made convinced Corvisart
that similarly the internal changes vary just as greatly as
do the external signs and symptoms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two most important treatises of which Corvisart was
the author are his “Treatise on Diseases of the Heart” and
his “Commentary on Auenbrugger’s Work.” Nowhere in
medical literature, says Cuvier, will one find a more methodical
or a more clearly written treatise on this subject than
the first of these treatises. In the second one the author
analyzes the different alterations in the lungs, bronchi and
pleura which may be distinguished by means of Auenbrugger’s
method. In the form which Corvisart has given to
this second work we obtain the clearest evidence of his
generous character. Rather than rob this man who had
long been dead, and who was entirely unknown to him, of
even a small portion of what was his due, Corvisart preferred—to
use the expression employed by Cuvier—to immolate
his own glory. It appears that before he had learned
anything whatever about the work that Auenbrugger had
published in 1763, he had himself made the majority of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>discoveries set forth in that author’s treatise and was making
preparations to publish them to the world. Just at this
moment, however, he unexpectedly found a copy of a French
translation of Auenbrugger’s dissertation, whereupon he
abandoned his original plan and published instead the
“Commentaries.”  In his preface he gives the following
explanation of the course which he adopted:—“I might
have—if I had so wished—sacrificed the name of Auenbrugger
to my own vanity; but my object is to revive the knowledge
of his splendid and legitimate discovery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1789 Corvisart published the MSS. which Desbois de
Rochefort had left to him as trustee. Already in 1788, as
stated on a previous page, he had been appointed, by a
unanimous vote, Physician to La Charité Hospital. From
the very start he took up with enthusiasm the work of
clinical instruction in this hospital, and kept it up for nearly
twenty years, thus gaining for himself—according to Dupuytren—the
reputation of being the leading medical practitioner
of his day, and adding great distinction to French
medicine. In 1795, when the first <i>École de Médecine</i> was
created, he was made “Clinical Professor of Medicine”;
and from this time forward, for a period of several years,
he carried on the work of clinical teaching practically
without a rival.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the positions which he held at <i>l’École de
Médecine</i> and at La Charité Hospital Corvisart was connected
in some teaching capacity with the <i>Collège de
France</i>. At first he gave instruction in this institution only
in the theory of medicine, but after 1795 he was formally
installed in the College as a teacher of practical medicine;
and from this time forward he was able so to arrange his
lectures that those students who attended his clinical
instruction at La Charité, would be able to hear him, later
in the day, explain more fully the diagnosis, treatment, etc.,
which he had adopted in the morning. In his manner of
conducting these sittings Corvisart was largely guided by
Stoll’s “Aphorisms,” a practical work which combined the
genius of Boerhaave and that of Stoll,—a work in which
problems and demonstrated truth were most happily combined.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Corvisart was so impressed with the value of this
treatise (“Aphorisms”) that he published a translation of
it in 1797.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a lecturer Corvisart possessed an animated and
sparkling style of delivery and great clearness of expression.
When asked why he improvised these lectures before
the students, instead of writing them out beforehand, he
said: “In lecturing I like to feel absolutely at my ease and
not to be under the restraint which one feels after a formal
preparation beforehand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the hospital it was his practice to submit to the students
for inspection and consideration only the most serious
and the most typical cases. From the bedside he went, in
company with the entire class, to the amphitheatre, and
there entered upon a more complete description and discussion
of what they had witnessed in the ward. If the patient
died, then he took them with him to the dead-house and
showed them whatever the autopsy revealed. Before doing
so, however, he read to them a brief history of the case, in
order to refresh their memory. Then, after the autopsy
had been completed, he reviewed and compared the two sets
of facts. As the author of this particular eulogy remarks,
“One can imagine with what intense interest the students
followed this last act in the course of instruction which
Corvisart gave them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Bonaparte was made Emperor of France one of his
early acts was to appoint Corvisart, who had been instrumental
in effecting his recovery from a serious pulmonary
attack, his First Physician. This position was not, as might
easily be imagined, that of a mere personal adviser; it was
a much more important office, or at least it became so in the
hands of Dr. Corvisart. He felt very strongly that he must
use this great increase in his personal influence, not for himself
nor for his immediate circle of friends, but for the
benefit of the nation and for the advancement of the science
of medicine. As an illustration of the spirit in which Corvisart
interpreted the attitude which he should maintain
in the face of his new responsibilities I will mention the
following incident:—On one occasion, when the Emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>startled him with the announcement that he held in his
hands the official appointment of his brother to a position
connected with the Government, Corvisart remarked:
“Allow me, your Majesty, to decline, for my brother, this
position; he does not possess the necessary capacity. I
know that he is poor, but that is a matter which concerns
only myself.” After Corvisart left the room Napoleon,
turning to one of his ministers who happened to be present,
asked him: “Do you know of many men like this man?” On
another occasion, when Corvisart happened to be the subject
of conversation, the Emperor remarked: “He is an
honest and skilful man, but a little brusque.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Among his numerous acts of generosity toward his
friends and benefactors there were some which showed that
he did not forget his teachers nor even the hospitals. He
established at <i>l’École de Médecine</i> a prize fund which had
for its purpose to aid those who found it impossible, through
lack of funds, to continue their scientific experiments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, it should not be forgotten that it was Corvisart
who suggested to Bonaparte,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a> the First Consul, the propriety
of erecting at Hôtel-Dieu the monument in honor of Desault
and Bichat. (See page <a href='#Page_167'>167</a>.) By reason of the various
responsibilities which very soon began to burden Corvisart
he was obliged to give up, one after the other, his clinical
teaching and finally his practice; it had become impossible
for him to do justice to so many things. Thus, he resigned
his Chair of Clinical Medicine in 1807, and in 1814, after the
fall of Napoleon, he retired to his countryseat, where he
hoped to regain in some measure the health which had
begun to break down under the numerous burdens which he
had been carrying. His death occurred on September 18,
1821.</p>

<p class='c007'>From among the comments that were published by his
contemporaries soon after Corvisart’s death I select the
following as well adapted to complete the portrait of this
remarkable man:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Among his professional brethren Corvisart was admitted
to have gained a high degree of skill in the power to diagnose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>diseases of the chest by means of percussion, and especially
to have advanced our knowledge of affections of the
heart and its annexes. No less important are the services
which he rendered to physicians through his valuable and
inspiriting clinical teaching. It was particularly in this
form of teaching that he showed in what a rare degree he
possessed the power of interesting his auditors in the case
which happened to be at that moment under consideration.
Corvisart was equally successful as a teacher of pathological
anatomy, and nobody, since the time of Bichat, did more
than he to develop in France the love of researches in
pathological anatomy. However, despite their fascination
with the study of the pathological lesions presented by the
different organs of the body after death, these pupils rarely
seemed anxious to harmonize them with the symptoms
manifested by the patient during his lifetime. They persisted
in forgetting the remarks made by their teacher on
this very point, to wit:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The most desirable thing, the thing which we should particularly
strive to find out because it is that which is most important in
practical medicine, is not what are the peculiarities discernible in
the cadaver, but to recognize the existence of these pathological
lesions from certain signs and symptoms manifested during life.</p>

<p class='c019'>The only works which Corvisart has handed down to
posterity are the following:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Essai sur les maladies et les lésions organiques du coeur et des
gros vaisseaux,” Paris, 1806. (3d edition, 1818.)</p>

<p class='c018'>“Nouvelle méthode pour reconnaître les maladies internes de la
poitrine, par la percussion de cette cavité,” par Auenbrugger;
ouvrage traduit du latin et commenté par J. N. Corvisart, Paris,
1808.</p>

<p class='c019'>Corvisart’s comments constitute a large and important
part of the book last mentioned, and virtually make of it an
original work by Corvisart. Auenbrugger’s original treatise
was published in 1763 and was then, according to Dezeimeris,
entirely forgotten, notwithstanding the fact that in
1770 it was translated into French by Rozière de la Chassagne.
Auenbrugger was the first physician who recognized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the fact that, by percussion of the walls of the chest, a diagnosis
may be made of some of the diseases affecting the
organs contained therein. Corvisart practiced Auenbrugger’s
percussion method during a period of twenty years
and was in the habit of demonstrating it to the numerous
students who attended his courses in clinical medicine. It
was this long experience in the practice of percussion that
enabled him to extend, correct and modify the method as it
was set forth in Auenbrugger’s little treatise. If he had
not done this and had not published the results in his
French translation (of 1808), Auenbrugger would not have
won the credit for his glorious discovery. The delicately
considerate manner in which Corvisart engineered the
whole scheme throws a flood of light upon the noble
character of Napoleon’s First Physician.</p>

<p class='c014'>LAËNNEC AND THE INVENTION OF THE MODERN METHOD OF AUSCULTATION; PAUL-JOSEPH BARTHEZ</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>René Théophile Hyacinthe Laënnec</span> (1781–1826) was
born at Quimper in Brittany, France. I am not able to furnish
any details concerning his early history. His subsequent
career as a physician, however, and especially his
writings, show very clearly that he must have received a
very careful and thorough education. Previous to 1816
auscultation of the chest was carried out in the same manner
as it was in the time of Hippocrates,—that is, by applying
the examiner’s ear, either directly or through an interposed
piece of linen, to the surface of the skin overlying
the particular part which he was desirous of examining.</p>

<p class='c017'>In 1816 I was consulted [writes Laënnec] by a young woman
who presented certain general symptoms that pointed to the existence
of some disease of the heart, and in whom, by reason of her
<i>embonpoint</i>, simple palpation and percussion could scarcely be
expected to furnish satisfactory information in regard to the nature
of the disorder. The age and sex of the patient not permitting me
to make such an examination as I have just mentioned I was compelled
to adopt some other measure; and I then recalled to mind the
acoustic phenomenon with which everybody is familiar, to-wit: if
the ear be applied to one end of a wooden beam it will perceive with
perfect distinctness the sound made by the scratching of a pin’s
point on the opposite end of the beam. From this circumstance I
inferred that in the present case I might advantageously utilize the
principle underlying this phenomenon. Accordingly I rolled up
into a cylinder-shaped, stiff-walled tube several sheets of writing-paper,
and, resting one end of the cylinder on the skin of the precordial
region, I applied my ear to the other end of the tube. I
found to my surprise and pleasure that I was now able to hear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>pulsations of the heart much more distinctly than I had ever before
heard them when I applied my ear directly to the chest-wall.</p>

<p class='c019'>This first experience made such a deep impression on the
mind of Laënnec that he promptly instituted a series of
experiments which had for their object (1) the determination
of the form of instrument that would best answer the
desired purpose, and (2) the discovery of the various cardiac
and pulmonary conditions that might advantageously
be studied by the use of this instrument. Such were the
first steps taken in one of the most useful medical discoveries
of which we have any record. Auscultation, the
importance of which had been dimly foreseen by Hippocrates
the Great, became now for the first time, in the early
part of the nineteenth century, one of the most effective aids
to the physician in ascertaining the true nature and extent
of certain diseases located in the cavity of the chest, in
watching their progress, and in regulating their treatment
in accordance with the physical conditions revealed by the
aid of the method. The history of medicine has few more
important events to record than this discovery made by
Laënnec, one of France’s greatest physicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of the experiments to which I have just
referred there was soon substituted for the crude thin-walled
paper cylinder a solid column of light wood, hollowed
out centrally throughout its length by a narrow tubular
channel. To this new instrument the name “stethoscope”
was given. It would require too great an amount of space
to give here the full and very explicit instructions supplied
by Laënnec regarding the manner in which this instrument
is to be employed in actual practice; and, furthermore, they
are to be found in the best modern textbooks which deal
with diseases of the chest.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Stethoscopic auscultation is by no means the simple
operation which many physicians believe it to be. It is an
art which must be learned through long practice, and is
attainable to its fullest extent only by those who possess, in
the first place, a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the
organs contained within the thoracic cavity,—both the gross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>anatomical relations of the different organs and the minute
structure of the different subdivisions of the pulmonary
mass. A good knowledge of the mode of action of all this
vascular and respiratory machinery, under normal conditions,
is also necessary. He who really becomes an expert
in the art of successful auscultation must necessarily be
equipped with a knowledge of the different acoustic phenomena
that present themselves to the examiner’s hearing
under the various pathological states to which both the
heart and the lungs are liable. All these facts are brought
out with great fulness of detail by Laënnec in the second
edition (1826) of his treatise. (I have not examined the
English translation of Laënnec’s treatise, but presumably
all these details have been accurately reproduced in that
version.) A man without a delicate sense of hearing and
a well-trained imagination,—which latter gift may truly be
said to be possessed by comparatively few of those who
practice medicine,—will soon confess to himself that he is
able to gain only a very meagre modicum of satisfactory
information from the practice of the art of auscultation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Laënnec reports a large number of cases in which various
pulmonary and pleural disorders developed as complications
of the original affection, and in each such case he mentions in
full detail all the phenomena that were discovered on auscultation
and percussion of the chest. Some of these histories
are extremely interesting; they constitute a rich mine of
clinical data from which the practicing physician may draw
a great fund of useful information. A mere list of the headings
of these reports would fill several of the pages of this
treatise. From the statements already made the reader is
likely to infer that Laënnec is particularly strong in his presentation
of the facts relating to the pathological anatomy
of pulmonary and cardiac diseases, as well as in his treatment
of the subject of auscultation in all its phases; and in
drawing this inference he would be wholly in the right.
Laënnec’s treatise furnishes an exhaustive and thoroughly
practical discussion of the various diseases of the heart and
lungs, and stands for all time as a glorious monument in his
honor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Magendie, speaking before a class of medical students at
Hôtel-Dieu about the difficulties which the physician occasionally
encounters in his efforts to interpret correctly the
significance of certain sounds heard during auscultation,
narrates the following experience:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Here, gentlemen, is the heart of a young woman who recently
died in this hospital. I believe that I have already published an
account of her case, which is one of exceptional interest; but, however
this may be, I remember perfectly well all the details of the
results ascertained (during life) by a careful auscultation of her
heart. The first sound was heard without any difficulty, but the
second one was entirely lacking. What, it will be asked, was the
cause of this phenomenon? At first I was disposed to believe that
she was affected with hydrothorax, but, when I came to make a
more careful examination, I was obliged to reject this hypothesis;
and, although I suspected that the absence of the second sound was
due to an obstacle of a mechanical nature,—one that nullified the
stroke communicated by the heart to the sternum,—I was unable
to form any idea as to the real nature of this obstacle. The present
autopsy furnishes the desired explanation. As a result of a former
attack of pericarditis the anterior surface of the heart was covered
with a thick layer of false membranes; ... the tip of the organ,
on the other hand, still preserved its usual smooth and polished
aspect.... In my judgment the interposition of false membranes,
which had been deposited upon the surface of the heart, acted as a
cushion, thus preventing the transmission of the sound by annulling
the shock which would otherwise result from the blow upon the
sternum. Lower down, at the tip of the organ, where no false membranes
had been deposited, the blow upon the thorax, caused with
each systole of the heart, produced the normal degree of noise.</p>

<p class='c018'>(From Magendie’s “<i>Leçons sur les Phénomènes Physiques de la
Vie</i>.”)</p>

<p class='c019'>I should perhaps add here the statement that Laënnec’s
researches into the question of auscultation of the chest
were made at the Necker Hospital in Paris, and extended
over a period of eighteen years.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Paul-Joseph Barthez</span>, one of the most distinguished physicians
of France during the eighteenth century, was born
at Montpellier on December 11, 1734. His father, who was
a civil engineer and well known as a clever mathematician,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>practiced his profession at Narbonne, and it was there that
the son spent the first years of his life. At a very early age
he manifested a decided love for study, and his parents took
great pains with his education. During the period of youth
he displayed two marked characteristics—sincerity and
very little inclination to indulge in social pleasures. On
more than one occasion he submitted to chastisement rather
than to tell a lie. As he advanced in age he showed a
marked tendency to choose an ecclesiastical career, but his
father was not at all disposed to encourage him in such a
choice, and finally induced him to give the preference to
medicine. Accordingly, Paul-Joseph, during the month of
November, 1750, was enrolled as a medical student at the
University of Montpellier. Three years later he passed the
required examinations with great credit and was given the
degree of Doctor of Medicine. In 1761 he made his first
appearance at Montpellier as a lecturer and met with a fair
degree of success. Up to this time he had experienced a
good deal of anxiety caused by his pecuniary troubles, but
during the succeeding years his practice steadily increased
and he was soon relieved from this source of trouble. In
1781, after the death of Dr. Tronchin, he was called to Paris
to take the doctor’s place as the private physician of the
Duke of Orleans. In the meantime, despite the greatly disturbed
condition of political affairs in Paris, and also despite
the persistent efforts of his enemies to drive him out of
the capital, Barthez managed to accumulate a fortune amply
sufficient for all his reasonable needs. In 1802 the First
Consul, Bonaparte, appointed him and Corvisart Government
Physicians,—Barthez for Montpellier and the southern
part of France, and Corvisart for Paris and the
northern part; and, a little later, Barthez was appointed
Bonaparte’s Consulting Physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toward the end of his life Barthez suffered a great deal
from bladder trouble, which proved eventually to be dependent
upon the presence of a calculus. Instead of submitting
at this time to a surgical operation, the only measure that
offered him any chance of permanent relief, he put his faith
in the use of lithontriptics; and then, when these proved to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>be impotent to give him relief, he expressed his willingness
to submit to an operation. But by that time his general condition
had become so unfavorable that it was not considered
safe to operate. His death occurred on October 15, 1806,
after he had passed through several weeks of very great
suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order that one may form a correct estimate of Barthez’
professional career it is necessary that certain facts
should be borne in mind. In the first place, he was endowed
with a prodigious memory, a remarkable capacity for grasping
facts, unlimited patience in studying their different
aspects, great ability in ascertaining their relations to one
another, and wonderful facility in following out the connections
between abstract ideas. Then, in addition, his
acquaintance with both ancient and modern languages made
it easy for him to familiarize himself with the sayings of the
philosophers and scientific men of all times and countries.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1785, after the death of Imbert, who at that time
occupied the important position of Chancellor of the University
of Montpellier, the highest medical office in the
southern half of France, Barthez was chosen his successor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were it not for the difficulty presented by the lack of
space I should be glad to add here, by way of example, a
reproduction, in English, of one of Barthez’ “<i>Consultations</i>,”
some of which are most instructive, and which furnish
at the same time an excellent picture of the manner of
procedure followed by this celebrated French diagnostician
and teacher of the science and art of medicine. Merely to
furnish a <i>résumé</i> of one of these chapters would not serve a
sufficiently useful purpose, and I must therefore abstain
from making any attempt whatever to supply the desired
portrayal. To those, however, who are interested more
particularly in the subject of syphilis I will venture to suggest
the perusal of Consultation XXXVI. (pp. 381–396), in
which Barthez gives a very complete report of the infection,
with that disease, of an entire family (father, mother and
several children). This report is well worth reading. In
addition to the “<i>Consultations de Médecine</i>,” which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>published in 1820 by Lordat, Barthez wrote the following
treatises:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Nouveaux Eléments de la Science de l’Homme</i>,” Montpellier,
1778 (1 vol.); Paris, 1806 (2 vols.); “<i>Traité des Maladies Goutteuses</i>,”

</div>
<p class='c014'>EARLY STUDIES OF THE DISEASE NOW UNIVERSALLY
CALLED TYPHOID FEVER</p>
<p class='c005'>Up to the year 1829 the disease now universally called
“typhoid fever” was known by a great variety of names,
all of them more or less objectionable and therefore not
acceptable to the majority of physicians. Here are a few
specimens of these terms: “gastritis” or “gastro-enteritis”;
“enteric fever”; “slow nervous fever”; “gastroentero-cephalitis”;
“abdominal typhus”; “pathogenic
fever,” etc. It is only in the last-mentioned name that we
find evidence of an attempt—only a very feeble attempt,
it is true—to suggest some connection between the term
proposed and the real cause of the disease. Chomel, in
1834, very quickly disposed of the first two names suggested
when he wrote: “At the present time no physician who is a
careful observer of disease and who at the same time is
well versed in pathological anatomy, looks upon typhoid
fever as a gastritis or a gastro-enteritis.” At about the
same time Philippe Pinel, the distinguished author of the
work entitled “<i>Nosographie Philosophique</i>,” made the following
statement with regard to typhoid fever: “In this
disease one cannot fail to observe that there exists, toward
the end of the small intestine, a violent inflammation of the
mucous membrane.” To go back farther still in the history
of medicine I will mention here the fact that Galen attributed
this and other epidemic fevers to the drinking of
infected water. Huxham and Pringle, two of the best English
authorities on fevers, frequently mention, as a cause of
typhoid fever, the drinking of polluted water in which are
contained decomposing animal matters. So far as I am
able to ascertain, however, Johann Peter Frank was the first
to throw doubt upon the correctness of this mode of causation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>or at least upon the correctness of the form in which the
statement is made. Putridity alone, he says, does not satisfactorily
explain the characteristic features of the disease.
“The cause of these nervous fevers,” he adds, “is not to be
found in putrid matter but rather in some principle, or primary
element, which easily combines with it,—an element
the nature of which is unknown to us.” Putrid matter,
then, was recognized by Frank as being simply the vehicle of
the cause of the disease (viz., a special <i>contagium vivum</i>).
Budd, in 1856, held very much the same view; and Murchison,
in 1857, agreed in the main with Budd.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The next suggestion of a new name for typhoid fever
came from Bretonneau, of Tours, France; his proposition
being that the disease should be called “<i>Dothiénentérite</i>”
(from δοθιὴν, the Greek word for pimple, and έντερον, intestine).
Certain authors attributed the associated fever to
these pimple-like lesions in the small intestine, but Bretonneau
held that the latter are the products of an infection
and not the cause of the fever; and that view has been universally
accepted as correct ever since his time. This new
term for typhoid fever, however, was not favorably
received, and was very soon forgotten. On the other hand,
the expression “typhoid fever” (from τῦφος, stupor, and
εὶδος, form), which simply described the most noteworthy
feature of the disease, was promptly adopted. Charles A.
P. Louis,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Chief of Clinic at the <i>École de Médecine</i> of Paris,
and Member of the <i>Académie Royale de Médecine</i>, to whom
we are indebted for the final settlement of this troublesome
question, gives the following brief account of the considerations
which led him to urge the final acceptance of the term
“typhoid fever”: “After seeking carefully for a term that
would express the anatomical features of this disease, without
jarring too decidedly upon the ear, as ‘<i>dothiénentérite</i>’
does, and having failed to discover any better expression
than ‘typhoid fever,’ I finally decided to employ it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>preference to all others.” And since that time no physician
has succeeded in supplanting it with a term more acceptable
to the Profession. As to the real underlying cause of
typhoid fever I shall have nothing to say, as this is a matter
which belongs strictly to the domain of modern medicine;
and I have no wish to trespass upon the territory of the
writer of this most important section of the history of
medicine.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the contagiousness of typhoid fever Louis states
that, out of 117 cases which he had observed, there were
only three that might be imputed to contagion.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few words more concerning Charles A. P. Louis, to
whom I have already referred briefly in connection with the
subject of selecting a suitable name for typhoid fever. Marshall
Hall, the famous English physician, characterizes him
as the greatest pathologist of any nation or of any age. In
another place he says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Monsieur Louis is the Bacon of Medicine; he has taught us how
to observe, and how to deduce important laws from the facts observed....
Monsieur Louis is a man of such talent, labour, exactness,
truth, and probity, as I never met with in any other man. His
labours I shall consider as the chief ornament of these lectures, and
my chief claim to your consideration.</p>

<p class='c019'>In still another place Marshall Hall quotes Louis’ own
account of the early years of his professional career, as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'>After having practised as a physician in a foreign country, I
returned to France, at the age of thirty-three, determined to give
myself up to the observation of disease; and, in order to obtain
my end more effectually, I resolved to forego all other employment.
I pursued this course for nearly seven years; in other words, during
that time I devoted myself exclusively to the observation of all the
cases admitted into St. John’s and St. Joseph’s wards at the hospital
of <i>La Charité</i>. Three years elapsed before I ventured to publish,
at the request of a friend, my first memoir, on the perforation
of the small intestines; my object being to observe for myself, and
not to describe what I might have observed.</p>

    <div><span class='large'>THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF BROUSSAIS’ TEACHING</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>François Joseph Victor Broussais</span> was born in 1772 at
Saint-Malo, a seaport on the north coast of France, in the
Department of Ille-et-Vilaine (formerly a part of Brittany).
His early medical training was obtained at Paris,
where he attended for a short time one of the courses of
instruction given by Bichat. On reaching the age of forty-two
he entered the service of the Military Hospital at Val-de-Grâce,
and not long afterward was chosen Professor of
General and Special Pathology and Therapeutics at the
University of Paris. The lectures which he delivered on
these subjects so fascinated the students and the numerous
physicians who attended the course in increasing numbers,
that—as Pagel expresses it—a general impression was
created, during a period of several successive years, that
the whole of French medicine was represented in the person
and doctrines of Broussais. The correctness of Pagel’s
statement is corroborated by the following extract from
“J. L. H. P’s sketches”:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Monsieur Broussais is unquestionably the most remarkable medical
writer of the present age. Splendid works, celebrated lectures,
and a great number of proselytes, have in a few years spread far
and wide his name and his opinions.... There are, on the other
hand, many physicians, who, too old to return now to their studies,
and witnessing with no pleasure all these innovations, say that the
professor of Val-de-Grâce is only a sectary, in whom passion holds
the place of genius, and hardihood of force.... His brutal attacks
on men, whether dead or living,—French or foreigners, surrounded
with the esteem and admiration of all,—have found approval only
among the personal enemies of the contemporaries whom he criticises,
and this too in a generation greedy of novelty, and imposed
upon by his rough manners and bold speech.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>The extract also shows that not a few French physicians
refused to accept the “fascinating” doctrines promulgated
by Broussais, and reported by him to be “founded on physiological
principles.” As Broussaism played such an important
part, during the early years of the nineteenth century,
in hindering the advance of the real science of medicine, my
readers will pardon me, I am sure, if I devote considerable
space in the attempt to elucidate the meaning of Broussaism.
These revolutionary ideas regarding “physiological
medicine” were first published in book form in 1816.
Two later editions followed,—one in 1821 and another in
1829. The text is arranged in the form of propositions or
“physiological principles,” of which there are 568. Pagel
describes them as “not being related in the remotest degree
to modern physiology.” In the following paragraphs I
have reproduced (in the form of translations) a few of these
“<i>Propositions de Médecine</i>” as they are printed in the
edition of 1829:—</p>

<p class='c017'>II.—Heat, from whatever source it may be derived, is the first
and most important of all stimuli; and, when it ceases to exert its
vitalizing power upon the economy, all other stimuli lose their
power to produce any effect upon it.</p>

<p class='c018'>IV.—If heat is withdrawn for a certain period of time all those
phenomena of the economy which are of a conservative, reparative
or medicative nature cease all activity; and the same is true when
oxygen is withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c018'>XX.—Assimilation, which is a phenomenon of the very first
order, cannot be explained by the assumption that it is due to the
action of sensibility and contractility; it should be looked upon
only as a manifestation of a creative force,—as an act of vital
chemistry.</p>

<p class='c018'>XLII.—Instinct consists of nervous impulses or stimuli—sometimes
associated with consciousness and sometimes not—which originate
in one of the viscera, and which call upon the central nerve
power to execute such acts as are necessary to the exercise of the
functions of that viscus.</p>

<p class='c018'>XLIV.—Acts which are originated by instinct are most frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>observed in infants, and are witnessed with diminishing
frequency as the child’s intelligence becomes more perfect.</p>

<p class='c018'>XLVII.—As may be said with equal truth of insanity the passions
furnish an example of the triumph of the viscera—that is to
say, of instinct—over intelligence; and, on the other hand, it is
well-known that the passions themselves produce insanity.</p>

<p class='c018'>LI.—The intellectual faculties may be exercised without any
participation of passion, but never without an accompaniment of
either pleasure or pain.</p>

<p class='c018'>LXIV.—An excess of haematosis or sanguification in an organ
increases at first the sum total of its vitality, but this increase is
subject to limitations. If, for example, the excitation is kept up
beyond a certain length of time the continued hyperaemia establishes
in that organ a condition which deserves to be called disease.</p>

<p class='c017'>XCIX.—When irritation causes the blood to accumulate in a
part or tissue, and when, further, this accumulation of blood is
accompanied by such an exceptional degree of swelling, redness and
heat as to threaten the disorganization of the part thus irritated,
it is customary to apply to this complex phenomenon the name of
“inflammation.”</p>

<p class='c018'>CXXVII.—Tubercles, cancers, etc., of the brain owe their origin
to a chronic inflammation of that organ.</p>

<p class='c018'>CLXVIII.—I have never seen tubercles of the lungs except in
cases where these lesions had developed from an antecedent inflammation;
and it does not appear to me that the tubercles which are
observed in the lungs of infants at birth, may rightly be considered
as having originated independently of inflammation.</p>

<p>BROUSSAIS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>These dozen or more of Broussais’ “<i>Propositions</i>” or
fundamental medical doctrines should suffice, it seems to me,
to give the reader a correct idea of the kind of physiology
and pathology that found favor in France during the third
and fourth decades of the nineteenth century, and that too
despite the thoroughly sound and admirably logical, but
less fascinating, teachings of such authorities as Morgagni,
Bichat, Ch. A. P. Louis, Bayle, Corvisart and Laënnec.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was toward the end of this same year (1821) that
Laënnec began teaching his new method of auscultating the
chest by means of the stethoscope—which had first been
made known to the world by Auenbrugger in 1761, but
which had been completely ignored until Corvisart published
a French translation of Auenbrugger’s book in 1808.
As early, however, as in 1819 Laënnec had published reports
of a number of instances in which, by means chiefly of this
method of exploration, he had correctly diagnosed the presence
of tuberculous and other deposits in the lungs of certain
patients. The publication of these reports evidently
excited very much the wrath of Broussais, for in the new
edition of his book (viz., that of 1821) he criticises Laënnec’s
statements most unjustly and in a manner that reveals
how completely his mind was saturated with the belief that
what he calls “inflammation” is at the bottom of most of
the pathological phenomena encountered in medical practice.
Lack of space will not permit me to quote here more
than one or two of Broussais’ comments on the conditions
reported by Laënnec:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The pathological alterations, considered by themselves, are simply
curiosities, and are not of the slightest utility to anybody who may
feel disposed to study them; because they are all either the products
of simple inflammation, or else they owe their origin to some cause
which does not fall legitimately in the domain of physiological
pathology.</p>

<p class='c018'>(Copied from pp. 674, 676, 677, and 679 of Vol. II., edition of
1821.)</p>

<p class='c019'>Further on in the same volume, speaking of melanotic
cancers, Broussais says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>... this is all that it is important for the physician to know;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and, as to what Monsieur Laënnec has written about black cancers,
I may say that it is simply the product of his imagination, a gloomy
romance, which I found difficulty in reading from the beginning to
the end.</p>

<p class='c019'>It seems proper that I should furnish some information
concerning Broussais’ methods of treatment in different
diseases. In the last analysis it will be found that in nearly
all cases he adopted such remedial measures as tended to
allay or arrest inflammatory action. Thus, in beginning
pulmonary consumption he prescribed the application of
leeches to the infraclavicular region; in jaundice they were
to be applied in the hypochondriac region, in pharyngitis
and tonsillitis to the side of the neck, in dysentery to the
anus, in articular rheumatism to the neighborhood of the
affected joint, and, in maladies that were not distinctly
localized, the epigastrium was the region to be chosen by
preference. When simple irritation was present Broussais
prescribed revulsives—such, for example, as blisters, emetics
and laxatives. As a rule, however, he gave the preference
to direct antiphlogistic measures. He is credited with
having had a profound contempt for the <i>vis medicatrix
naturae</i>. It was said that his pupils showed a tendency
to push his pathologic teachings to an extreme. Desruelles,
for instance, was in the habit of treating his syphilitic cases,
not with mercury or any other of the specific remedies commonly
employed at that period, but with leeches applied
locally.</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as in 1816 Broussais announced that, as a result
of his doctrine, “the mortality of Val-de-Grâce had greatly
diminished, to the grand astonishment and admiration of
the world.” This assertion not having been noticed, Monsieur
Broussais, in 1821, went a step further. He then predicted,
in the Preface to his “<i>Examen des Doctrines</i>,” that
his doctrine would soon exert an influence on population
more marked than that exerted by vaccination. This was
pretty strong, but not, however, sufficient; for in 1822, “the
Prospectus of <i>Les Annales de la Médecine Physiologique</i>
declared that, in the hospitals where the physiological doctrine
was adopted, the mortality was only one in thirty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>while in the others it amounted to one in five.” These
results, which caused great astonishment, induced Monsieur
Brasquet, a physician, to inspect the records with a view to
ascertaining the exact facts. Thus it was discovered that,
during the five years from 1815 to 1819, Monsieur Broussais
had lost more patients than his contemporaries had lost
during the same period; his mean mortality having been
one in thirteen. (The results of Monsieur Brasquet’s
inquiry were published in the <i>Revue Médicale</i>.) “Monsieur
Broussais replied in <i>Les Annales de la Médecine Physiologique</i>,
but his reply was not at all satisfactory. He did not
deny the correctness of the figures published in the <i>Revue
Médicale</i>, but he maintained that they proved nothing
against him.” The proof, however, that he had lost <i>one
patient in thirteen</i>, and not <i>one in thirty</i>, as he had claimed,
remained unshaken.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was probably this experience that marked the beginning
of the downfall of the doctrine known as “Broussaism”;
but many years had to elapse before this doctrine
vanished entirely from the accepted medical textbooks.
August Hirsch, in his “History of the Medical Sciences in
Germany” (1893), passes the following judgment upon
Broussais’ work: “Under the title of ‘Physiological Medicine’
Broussais presented to the world a system which for
narrowness of scope, for arbitrariness and for the perniciousness
of the treatment which was deduced from the
premisses that grew out of the theory, could be compared
only with Rasori’s therapeutic method.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Broussais died in 1835.</p>

<p class='c014'>J. L. PETIT, OF PARIS, AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
IN SURGERY—SABATIER, CHOPART,
DESAULT AND DUPUYTREN</p>
<p class='c005'>In the history of surgery in France there is a conspicuous
absence of distinguished names from the list of men who
succeeded Ambroise Paré, until we reach that of J. L. Petit,
a surgeon whose career shows him to have been worthy of
all the praise and esteem which the French have lavishly
bestowed upon him.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jean-Louis Petit</span> was born at Paris in 1674, and already
at the early age of twelve manifested a strong inclination to
adopt a surgical career. By the time he had reached his
sixteenth year he had become so expert as a dissector that
he was entrusted with the duties of a demonstrator of anatomy,
a position which he filled to the entire satisfaction of
both the students and the superior authorities of the medical
school. Two years later,—that is, in 1692,—he entered
the military service and was given the position of Army
Surgeon. He was present at the siege of Namur, and served
through all the succeeding campaigns up to the year 1697,
at which time he was placed in charge of the Military Hospital
at Tournay. In 1700 he retired from the army and
returned to Paris, where he engaged in private practice and
at the same time gave instruction in anatomy and surgery.
From this time forward his reputation as a skilful surgeon
rose rapidly until he was universally acknowledged to be
the leading surgeon of the capital, a fact which was confirmed
by his election to the position of Director of the
Royal Academy of Surgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was said of him by a very competent critic (A. Richet)
that Petit was one of the boldest and most skilful surgeons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of his day. He possessed a profound knowledge of the
anatomy of almost every region of the body, and at the
same time was remarkably skilful in the handling of his
bistouri. He also seemed to possess, on the spur of the
moment, an intuitive knowledge of what he should do in any
situation of affairs that might suddenly develop in the
course of an operation. The reflections which he made as
he progressed in the work with which he happened to be
busied, were most original, and led somebody to say of him,
on a certain occasion: “He must have invented surgery.”
On reading his treatise on surgical maladies one is struck
with the originality of his remarks, with the profoundness
of his thinking, and with the closeness and accuracy of his
observations. His writings make most attractive reading
for the surgeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order that my readers may judge for themselves how
cleverly and how wisely Petit dealt with some of the surgical
problems which presented themselves for solution in
the course of his private practice I will give here, in the
form of very brief translations, three instances which seem
to me to possess to-day a peculiar interest in that they
reveal the important fact that a correct diagnosis may occasionally
be made without the aid of some of the complicated
and expensive machinery which not a few of our modern
surgeons think indispensable to the ascertainment of the
truth. I should perhaps modify this last remark by stating
that the extraordinary cleverness and practical wisdom
exhibited by J. L. Petit are gifts not often bestowed by
Nature upon physicians, and that therefore the X-ray and
other modern inventions which compensate for the infrequency
of such gifts, are to be considered in the light
of very important blessings conferred upon suffering
humanity.</p>

<div id='i216'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i216.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>JEAN-LOUIS PETIT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>(1) “The man, whose case history I am about to relate, said that
the symptoms from which he had suffered, during the preceding
twelve months, were the following: a frequent but dry cough, with
loss of appetite; almost constant thirst; difficulty in obtaining
sleep; night-sweats, more marked in the region of the head and neck
than elsewhere; and irregular chills and fever. The physicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>whom he had consulted were led to believe that he was affected with
consumption, and they treated him in accordance with this belief,
but so far without success.—On examination I found that two of his
teeth were carious, and I advised their extraction. A rapid restoration
of the patient’s health followed in less than a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='c018'>(2) “The late Princess of Condé had interested herself greatly
in a young girl whom she had taken into her service. Upon her return
to Paris she took the girl with her, in the hope that the physicians
of that city would be able to cure her of the hemicrania (‘<i>Migraine</i>’)
from which the girl had frequently suffered during the
preceding five years. Bloodletting was the remedy adopted at that
period for nearly every malady, and these Paris physicians let her
have a full taste of this remedy, prescribing in rather rapid succession
twenty such bleedings, the arm, the foot and the region of the
throat being the localities selected for this operation. Medical students
were thought to be quite sufficiently competent for the management
of the arm and foot bloodlettings, but it was I who was
obliged to officiate when it became necessary to carry out the bleeding
from the neck. As this was the first occasion on which I saw the
patient I asked her a number of questions in order to learn the
more important facts concerning her malady; and then, failing to
discover any that seemed to me to justify the numerous bleedings to
which she had been subjected, I examined her mouth, not as a
casual matter, but because she had told me about having experienced
a sense of heaviness and numbness in her lower jaw. Observing
some irregularity in the arrangement of her teeth I counted
them, and discovered that there were eighteen instead of the sixteen
which are usually present; and it also seemed to me that the second
molar tooth on each side was crowding the others. After stating
these facts to the Princess, and obtaining her approval of the step
which I proposed to carry out, I had the two molars extracted;
whereupon, to the great astonishment of her ladyship and all of us,
the girl found herself, at the end of twenty-four hours, entirely
cured of a malady which had often, during the preceding five or
six years, been so distressing that she could not perform her regular
duties.” (Copied from Petit’s “<i>Traité des Maladies Chirurgicales</i>,”
etc.)</p>

<p class='c018'>(3) In another part of the same volume Petit reports in detail
the history of a case of middle-ear inflammation in which, after the
lapse of a few weeks, there developed symptoms that pointed very
strongly to the presence of a subdural collection of pus behind and
above the inflamed middle-ear. Whereupon, at a consultation that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>was held between the physicians in attendance upon this patient,
Petit urged the desirability of trephining the skull in order to give
vent to the contents of this assumed abscess. Such a proposition,
however, was promptly voted down by the other consultants. (The
events here described, it should be remembered, occurred somewhere
between 1750 and 1774.) Two or three weeks later, the patient’s
pain having become in the meantime more severe, the timid consultants
at last withdrew their opposition, and Petit performed the
trephining with success. Much foul-smelling pus was evacuated,
and after the lapse of a few weeks the patient was pronounced
cured.</p>

<p class='c019'>It would be easy to furnish here, from the printed record
already mentioned, additional instances showing the courage,
wisdom and skill exhibited by J. L. Petit in his practice
of the art of surgery. But the instances already cited amply
suffice, as it appears to me, to show the admirable character
of the man and his right to be considered the worthy
successor of Ambroise Paré.</p>

<p class='c007'>Petit’s death occurred in 1760.</p>

<p class='c007'>Petit made comparatively few contributions to medical
literature, and of these the shorter ones will be found in the
“<i>Journal des Savants</i>,” the “<i>Recueil des Mémoires de
l’Académie des Sciences</i>,” and the “<i>Mémoires de l’Académie
Royale de Chirurgie</i>.” His great work, which was
published in three volumes at Paris in 1774 (also a later
edition in 1790), bears the title: “<i>Traité des Maladies
Chirurgicales et des Opérations qui leur Conviennent</i>.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Raphael-Bienvenu Sabatier</span> was born at Paris on October
11, 1732. His father, Pierre Sabatier, was one of the
earliest members of the <i>Académie Royale de Chirurgie</i>, and
it was therefore quite natural that Raphael chose medicine
for his profession. There was nothing remarkable about
his early career. He worked hard at his studies of anatomy
and cultivated at the same time experimental physiology.
At the age of twenty-four he succeeded Balleul as Professor
of Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgery. In 1773 he
was made a member of the <i>Académie des Sciences</i>, and a
few years later, when the war broke out, he was ordered to
report, as a consulting surgeon, at the headquarters of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Army of the North, at Mons. But, his strength not permitting
him to perform the duties of this new position for any
length of time, he was soon allowed to return to his private
practice. Toward the end of his life Napoleon
appointed him one of his consulting surgeons, and at about
the same period of time the decoration of the Legion of
Honor was conferred on him. When the <i>École de Santé</i>
was established he accepted the Chair of Operative Surgery.
His death occurred on July 19, 1811.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sabatier was highly esteemed by his professional brethren.
Unlike Desault he brought forward no new inventions
or methods of treatment, but he constantly sought how he
might introduce some little improvement in existing well-established
methods. He was not of an enthusiastic temperament
and rarely did anything to call forth opposition
on the part of his associates. As a consequence he led a
most peaceful life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sabatier’s contributions to medical literature were
fairly numerous, and among them the following deserve to
receive particular mention:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Traité d’Anatomie</i>,” 3 vols., Paris, 1764.</p>

<p class='c018'>“<i>De la Médecine Opératoire</i>,” 3 vols., Paris, 1796; a second
edition appeared in 1810; and a third (in 4 vols.) in 1821–1824.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>François Chopart</span> was born at Paris in 1743. During his
youth he received a thorough preliminary training. From
the very beginning of his medical course he showed a decided
preference for surgery. Then, for a certain length
of time, he served as an <i>interne</i> at Hôtel-Dieu. Afterward
he was transferred first to La Pitié Hospital and then to
Bicêtre, where he devoted his attention mainly to syphilitic
affections. In 1767 he divided the prize offered by the
<i>Académie de Chirurgie</i> for the best memoir on the subject
of “The Nature and Treatment of Wens.” In 1768 he was
given an “Honorable Mention” for his memoir on “Injuries
of the Head produced by Contrecoup.” In 1770, after
passing with great credit the examinations required, he was
given on July 20, 1770, the degree of Master of Surgery;
and only one year later he was appointed Professor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Practical Surgery. His pupils were very much attached to
him on account of the interest which he manifested in their
work and because his teaching was so methodical and was
so clearly delivered. On March 13, 1782, he was chosen successor
to Bordenave, the Professor of Physiology; and a
little later he was elected to the Chair of External Pathology.
While on a visit to England he made the acquaintance
of John Hunter, and kept up an active correspondence with
him during the following years. He was also one of
Desault’s intimate friends. Being open-minded and frank
he got along pleasantly with all who came in contact with
him. He died in 1795 from an attack of cholera morbus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among his writings which deserve special mention are
the following: “<i>Traité des Maladies Chirurgicales et des
Opérations qui leur Conviennent</i>,” Paris, 1780, 2 vols.;
and “<i>Traité des Maladies des Voies Urinaires</i>,” Paris, 2
vols., 1701, and a later edition in 1821.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chopart is known to American and English surgeons
chiefly through the fact that he devised an amputation of
the foot which is commonly known as “Chopart’s amputation.”
The procedure is thus briefly described by Dr.
Thomas L. Stedman in his Medical Dictionary: “Disarticulation
at the metatarsal joint, leaving only the astragalus
and calcaneum, with the soft parts of the sole of the foot to
cover the stump.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pierre-Joseph Desault</span> was born on February 6, 1744, at
Magny-Vernois, a small village in the Department of Haute-Saone,
on the western slope of the Vosges mountains. At
the time of his birth his parents were living upon the income
derived from a modest fortune, and they found it very difficult
to support their family of seven. As soon as Pierre
was old enough to receive regular instruction he was placed
under the care of a private teacher at the neighboring village
of Lure, the chief centre of that district. In this way
he acquired an elementary knowledge of Latin and was
fitted, by the time he reached the age of twelve, to enter the
fifth form or class at the Jesuits’ college in Lure. His favorite
study, as soon became evident, was mathematics, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>this branch of knowledge he cultivated with such assiduity
and success that already at the age of seventeen he had
reached the point where all the elementary treatises to
which he had access no longer afforded him any satisfaction.
At a somewhat later period of his life, when he could no
longer receive help from his parents, this decided preference
for mathematics stood him in good stead, enabling him
to contribute to his own support by giving lessons in
geometry. It also aided him in making useful applications
of its principles to the art which he was soon to cultivate
with such conspicuous success—viz., surgery. He took
special delight at this time in the perusal of Borelli’s celebrated
treatise “on the movements of animals,” and even
went so far as to write a long commentary on this work.
Nothing, however, is now known about the fate of this document,
as Desault never published it nor showed at any time
a wish to become an author.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bichat, from whose eulogy of Desault I have derived
most of the facts which are reported in the present brief
sketch, says that during the years immediately preceding
the period which is now under consideration, surgery was
cultivated by artisans rather than by artists; and that, in
consequence of this situation of affairs, it was very slow in
making any advances which were worthy to be characterized
as genuine steps of progress. “Genius, when not appreciated,
escapes as mere froth; its efforts result in nothing
unless glory is the reward. Little by little, as the public
learned more and more how great was its need of surgery,
this art began to receive a larger share of consideration;
and thus, as it became more honorable, it was cultivated to
an ever greater degree, and as a result it advanced at a
more rapid pace toward perfection. In its different
branches, which were all working to accomplish some useful
purpose, new discoveries were constantly being made, and
thus it came about that from the middle of the eighteenth
century onward French surgery rapidly outdistanced the
surgery of all the other nations.” (Bichat.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It was at this period that Desault began his career as a
surgeon, and in the course of that career he did at least his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>full share in the work of supplying the deficiencies that
were observed in some of the methods commonly employed
at that period, in removing the positive defects that were
discovered in others, and in devising entirely new procedures.
At the same time Desault did not fail to recognize
the importance of making the foundations of his knowledge
as solid and firm as possible, and with this idea in mind he
spent all the time that he could possibly spare from the
clinical lessons which he was then giving, in utilizing the
anatomical material available in the dead-house of the hospital.
As his rivals stuck closely to the old methods of
instruction, and in addition were not endowed with his
remarkable gifts of teaching, of drawing all sorts of interesting
inferences from the anatomical relations of the part
or limb that was under consideration at the moment,
Desault rapidly outdistanced all his competitors. He was,
so far as I am able to learn from the printed records of this
period (1766), the pioneer of this particular type of instruction
(anatomical, pathological and clinical) in surgery in
the great Paris hospital Hôtel-Dieu. The young men who
attended these courses in ever increasing numbers were fascinated
by what they heard and saw,—for Desault always
taught with the cadaver or the living subject before him,—and
it soon became very noticeable that the attendance upon
the lectures given by his rivals (<i>i.e.</i>, the regular professors)
was falling off. Actuated by bitter jealousy these men managed
at first to have his permit to teach taken away from
him. But Antoine Louis and La Martinière, two of the
most influential surgeons of Paris, at that period, interfered
and so arranged matters that Desault was able to resume
his private courses. In fact, Louis made it clear, by his
presence at several of the sessions, that he approved of this
teaching and that he proposed to protect Desault against
all interference on the part of rivals. Desault’s method of
teaching, says Bichat, constituted the first development, in
France, of what is now known as surgical anatomy, a very
extensive and important department of the art of surgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another striking feature of Desault’s manner of giving
instruction is to be found in his invariable practice of demonstrating,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>whenever it was possible for him to obtain the
materials necessary for doing this, the alterations which are
produced in a part by disease or by accidental injuries, and
also the influence exerted by these lesions upon the neighboring
tissues or organs. In these demonstrations he never
allowed his mind to wander in the direction of pointing out
something akin to a discovery in pathology; he stuck closely
to the questions that were under immediate consideration,
thus giving preference, over everything else, to what was of
chief importance to the students.</p>

<p class='c007'>By thus conducting his teaching always with an eye single
to the best interests of his pupils Desault became, in the
course of a very few years, the most celebrated teacher of
surgical anatomy in France. His rivals laid stress upon
this particular feature of his fame in the hope of thereby
belittling, in public estimation, the equally important celebrity,
which he was now shortly to attain, of being also a
great surgeon. It is in some such words as these which I am
using that Bichat, who was his favorite pupil and righthand
man during this period of his career, records the
efforts made by his jealous rivals to interfere with Desault’s
professional success.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the early stages of his career as a surgeon Desault
gave instruction in operative surgery, but in a comparatively
short time he advanced beyond this stage and showed
that he possessed considerable originality. He invented a
very effective method of treating a fractured clavicle by the
application, to the shoulder, the elbow and the chest, of a
bandage which even to this day is known as “Desault’s
bandage.” In planning this bandage its inventor first calculated
with great care the forces which play the principal
part in causing the displacement of the two segments of the
fractured clavicle. This manner of attacking the problem
of how best to treat such a fracture was, so Bichat declares,
not that which had usually been followed by his predecessors,
but it nevertheless proved to be the correct way of
finding the right remedy. He believed, for example, that,
inasmuch as the external segment or fragment is pulled
downward by the weight of the shoulder and forward and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>inward by the action of the muscles, the right course to pursue
must, first, be to furnish proper support to the shoulder,
and at the same time to draw the external fragment outward
and backward. He realized that by the employment of continuing
extension it would be practicable to effect these
results. So, placing a cushion over the chest, to serve in
some measure as a point or angle of resistance, and resting
the arm firmly against it, he was able, by pressing the
lower part of the arm closer to the chest, to cause the upper
part, together with the fragment attached, to stand out
from this part of the trunk. Thus, as it were by a single
stroke, he succeeded in obtaining a result which, for a very
long period of time, had eluded the best efforts of the surgeon’s
art. This was a great triumph for Desault, but its
importance was not immediately appreciated. The bandage
was successfully used at the Salpétrière, one of the larger
hospitals of Paris, but the full recognition of its value came
only after the lapse of many years,—indeed, not until after
the death of its inventor. To-day it occupies an important
place in the history of surgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the other improvements in surgical procedures that
we owe to Desault I will mention here only one—that of
ligating the exposed ends of the larger arteries which had
been divided in the course of the amputation of a limb.
Ambroise Paré, it will be remembered, was the first to introduce
this practice in France (early in the seventeenth century),
but it failed to meet with general acceptance and was
then abandoned for more than a century. At Bicêtre,
another of the large hospitals of Paris, the practice of immediately
ligating the divided blood-vessels after an amputation
was first revived by Desault, and not long afterward
Ferrand also introduced the revived method at Hôtel-Dieu.
From this time onward it became the standard method of
procedure.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1788 Desault succeeded Ferrand as Chief Surgeon of
Hôtel-Dieu, and from this time forward, for five years, he
conducted with great success regular instruction in clinical
surgery. Then, toward the end of May, 1793, he was thrown
into the prison of the Luxembourg, the charge brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>against him being that he had refused to give his professional
services to those wounded in the affair of the previous
10th of August. He was retained as a prisoner only
three or four days; but from this time to the day of his
death (June 1, 1795) he was kept in almost constant fear of
being prosecuted, and was consequently prevented in large
degree from doing any useful work in surgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his analysis of Desault’s career as a surgeon Bichat
calls attention to the fact that the establishment of a clinical
school at Hôtel-Dieu was not the only benefit which he conferred
upon that hospital. He did much more than this; he
improved the arrangement and the ventilation of the different
wards, established better methods of distributing the
food systematically among the patients, increased their
comfort by making rules whereby their wants would be
more promptly supplied, etc. All matters of this nature
occupied the first place in his thoughts and drove out of his
mind, long before he died, all ambition to accumulate a fortune.
Despite the stormy conditions which prevailed during
the Revolution and which upset completely all the existing
arrangements in Paris, he managed to keep up a good part
of his clinical courses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking of Desault’s personal traits of character Bichat
says that he was somewhat quick-tempered, but that he
promptly got over his bad temper and was then once more
gentle and reasonable in his speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had his full share of enemies. In nearly all cases this
enmity sprung from jealousy. But what really great man,
adds Bichat, ever passed through life without being annoyed
by enemies through jealousy? On the other hand, Desault
had excellent friends, men who—as he expressed it—were
the joy of his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Desault was not of a scientific turn of mind; he never
wrote articles or took active part in any discussions. Some
of the best of the pupils who attended his courses took full
notes of his lectures, and these, after Bichat had revised
them and edited them, were published under the title of
“The Surgical Works of Desault.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span><span class='sc'>Guillaume Dupuytren</span> was born at Pierre Buffière,
France, October 5, 1778. He commenced the study of anatomy
and physiology at an unusually early age, and was appointed
Prosector at the Paris <i>École de Santé</i> before he had
reached his eighteenth year. In 1802, very soon after he
had received the degree of Doctor of Surgery, he was given
the appointment of Attending Surgeon to Hôtel-Dieu. Of
this early period of his career very little need be said. He
lost none of his enthusiasm for his chosen work and was
recognized by all his associates as a surgeon of great promise.
From the position of simple attending surgeon at
Hôtel-Dieu he rose in 1808 to that of Adjunct Surgeon-in-Chief.
Finally, in 1815, after the death of Pelletan, he was
made full Surgeon-in-Chief of that great hospital. So far
as it was possible for Dupuytren to advance in the endeavor
to gain official recognition as a surgeon, he had by this time
risen to the highest point that it was practicable for him to
reach. Let us now consider some of the other aspects of
his career.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>DUPUYTREN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After the death of Bichat in 1802 Dupuytren turned his
attention from what was supposed to be normal anatomy to
pathological anatomy. The change was greatly favored by
the fact that, in the course of his regular work as prosector,
he was constantly encountering all sorts of pathological
conditions, and thus he gradually acquired a strong interest
in pathological problems. Pathological anatomy, as newly
interpreted, was no longer a mere observing of the abnormal
changes which take place in different structures and
organs of the body,—the sort of “cold work” which had
occupied in large measure the minds of Bartholinus, Mangetus,
Bonnet of Geneva, Morgagni of Bologna, and Lieutard,
and which involved practically no study of the origin of
such changes,—but what might be termed a living pathological
anatomy, in which the effort is made to ascertain the
beginning, the gradual progress and the termination of the
process. Ample material for this sort of study was constantly
passing through Dupuytren’s hands, and he made
the most of his opportunities. Professor LeClerc, who is
my chief authority for the present sketch of Dupuytren,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>says that by means of this new pathological anatomy much
light was thrown upon both diagnosis and symptomatology.
At first the courses which Dupuytren gave in the <i>École de
Santé</i> ran in large degree parallel with those of Bichat, but
after the latter’s death Dupuytren had the field almost
entirely to himself. He taught anatomy, pathological anatomy,
and physiology, and increased the interest in his teaching,
on the part of the pupils, by furnishing a variety of
facts drawn from his wide experience. His great skill as a
dissector enabled him to demonstrate all sorts of fine details—as,
for example, not merely a limited portion of a
nerve, but nerves throughout their entire course.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Dupuytren became full Surgeon-in-Chief at Hôtel-Dieu
he ceased teaching operative surgery and devoted
himself largely to clinical surgery. He adopted the habit
of visiting the hospital at an early hour, long before the
time appointed for the arrival of the class, and thus he was
able to examine the patients leisurely and to give all the
necessary instructions to his assistants. By the time the
class arrived he was entirely ready to receive them. He
was extremely punctual in attending to his hospital duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1814 Dupuytren took an active part in caring for the
wounded soldiers on the field of battle; and again in 1830,
during the civic disorders of that period, he had the care,
at Hôtel-Dieu, of many cases of wounds from firearms.</p>

<p class='c007'>A French physician whose identity is concealed under
the initials J. L. H. P., has published a very complete pen-portrait
of Dupuytren’s most prominent personal and professional
characteristics, and Elisha Bartlett, M.D., of Boston,
has furnished us with an excellent English translation
of this work. From this book I shall take the liberty of
quoting here several sections that seem to me to be particularly
interesting.</p>

<p class='c017'>Monsieur Dupuytren is, in my opinion a surgeon of the most exalted
merit.... He has a <i>coup d’oeil</i> of most admirable precision,
a sure and steady hand, a coolness and self-possession always imperturbable,
and that innate instinct or tact so necessary in all the arts.
A man is born surgeon or physician, as a man is born poet or
painter.... Monsieur Dupuytren is particularly remarkable for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>his diagnostic foresight.... Arrived at the bedside of the patient,
his fine senses are all awake; in a few minutes of question and researches,
his examination is finished. One might often believe that
he has given to the case only a superficial attention, but his subsequent
lecture will prove that he has seen everything and seen it
thoroughly.... He describes a pathological alteration, yet hidden
in the interior of an organ, as though it were visible, and, when the
scalpel has dissected and uncovered it, the truth of his description
is verified by all who witness it.... Monsieur Dupuytren is not
less skilful in treating surgical diseases than he is in detecting them....
I do not fear that I shall be accused of exaggeration in saying
that very few surgeons have given proof of so much surgical genius
in the invention of modes of operating or so much expertness in
their execution. Monsieur Dupuytren possesses in the highest
degree a creative and inventive spirit....</p>

<p class='c018'>So much for Monsieur Dupuytren as a practitioner; Let us now
consider him as an instructor....</p>

<p class='c018'>Since 1815, the surgical clinic of Hôtel-Dieu has lost none of its
ancient reputation. No other clinical course in France can be compared
to this, whether for the number of students, the abundance
of cases, or, finally, for the genius of the professor. In effect, Monsieur
Dupuytren comprehends perfectly in what clinical instruction
consists; a thing that ought to be somewhat difficult, seeing how
few there are who succeed in it. Lessons of clinical surgery have no
resemblance to a course of surgery.... A clinic is altogether a
different thing. The professor has need here to speak continually
without preparation, because the material of his lesson cannot be
regulated by himself, in advance, but is dependent upon chance,
which brings him, to-day, a strangulated hernia, to-morrow, a fracture;
and, in the same day, four or five different cases....</p>

<p class='c018'>An excellent practitioner, Monsieur Dupuytren thus really possesses
the most essential quality of a clinical professor. But to this
first fundamental qualification others ought to be united. The professor
ought to have a free command of language and the talent
of extemporaneous speaking; he should possess a memory sufficiently
good to recall distinctly all the circumstances of diseases,
and the peculiarities of the different treatments that he has
directed; it is necessary, that, thoroughly understanding the necessity
and obligations of his instruction, he should accustom himself
to return every day to things which he has a thousand times
repeated, unmindful of the fatigue resulting from such repetition;
above all, he should remember that he is occupied with inexperienced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>hearers, to whom it is not sufficient to say things imperfectly;
hearers who may easily be dazzled and led astray, but who ought
to be instructed, an end that cannot be attained without patience.
In respect to all these things, Monsieur Dupuytren is almost irreproachable....
As to myself, instructed by my personal experience,
and by the numerous comparisons that I have made, I do not
hesitate to believe and to say that the clinic of Monsieur Dupuytren
may be offered as a model of this kind of instruction.</p>

<p class='c019'>In his memoir concerning the medical schools of Paris,
John Gross, an English surgeon, says that no lectures at
the <i>École de Médecine</i> were so numerously attended as were
those delivered by Dupuytren on operative medicine. He
adds that at the lecture which he attended on the operation
for inguinal hernia, there were present about 1200 students,
the greatest number that the theatre is capable of containing.
“But I must confess that I have seldom learnt less
from any good practical lecture than I did from this. I was
too far off to distinguish well what I saw, or comprehend
what I heard; and I returned home with a feeling of regret,
that what is grand should be so far remote from what is
most useful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dupuytren’s health began to break down in 1833, and he
was obliged to take a trip to Italy. A certain amount of
improvement resulted from this journey, but only for a
brief period of time. On February 7, 1835, he died, leaving
in his will the sum of 200,000 francs to <i>l’École de Médecine</i>
for the establishment of a chair of pathological anatomy.
Before his death, however, he assented to the proposition
that the <i>École</i> should assume the responsibility of providing
funds sufficient for founding the professorship and thus
enable the authorities to utilize the legacy in establishing
an anatomical museum, the <i>Musée Dupuytren</i>, where all
sorts of pathological specimens may be carefully preserved
and exposed to view in well-constructed cabinets.

<p class='c014'>WORKERS IN SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS OF SURGERY:
DEMOURS, DESCEMET, DELPECH, FAUCHARD,
JOURDAIN, GARIOT</p>
<p class='c005'>In modern times such special departments as those devoted
to the care of the teeth, mouth and jaws, to the remedying
of defective eyesight and other affections of the eyes,
to the care of the organ of hearing, and to the cure of the
different disorders of the pharynx, larynx and nasal cavities,
have assumed the importance of independent fields of
surgical activity, and as such they demand and are receiving
to-day the attention which they deserve. But during the
eighteenth century the practicing physician was expected
to possess the knowledge and skill necessary for the relief
or cure of all such bodily ills, and he was forced to accept
the duties growing out of these problems as a regular part
of his day’s work. In the estimation of the general public
the holder of the degree of M.D. was credited—up to a comparatively
recent date—with the possession of knowledge
sufficient for the cure of <i>all</i> bodily ills; and one can now
easily imagine how greatly most of these men must have
suffered from the feeling that they were playing a false and
ignoble part whenever they accepted—as they did in many
cases of this nature—a degree of responsibility which they
were wholly unable to bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present chapter I shall discuss very briefly only
these three specialties: eye surgery, orthopedic surgery and
dental surgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Middle Ages there seem to have been at least two
men who were really skilled in eye surgery and who were
widely known in the southern portion of Europe as possessing
exceptional knowledge and skill in the treatment of this
class of maladies. I refer to Pierre Franco, of Lausanne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and Orange, and to Demosthenes of Marseilles. (Brief
references to the work of these two will be found in the
volume on “The Growth of Medicine.”) Then at Vienna,
Austria, as I have stated on a previous page, there were, in
the early part of the eighteenth century, Beer, Rosas, and
perhaps one or two others, who did excellent work in eye
surgery, and whose writings on this subject are still to-day
held in high esteem as trustworthy authorities. In France,
on the other hand, there were only two men who, in the
early part of the eighteenth century, seem to have devoted
their time and skill to the relief of affections of the eye—viz.,
Demours and Descemet.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pierre Demours</span> was born at Marseilles in the early part
of the eighteenth century, began the study of medicine at
Avignon, and then went to Paris for the completion of his
professional training. He received his doctor’s degree,
however, at Avignon in 1728, probably because the graduation
fees in the latter city were not so large as those required
in Paris. At a still later date he returned to the
capital for the further prosecution of his professional
studies, and while there he was given the appointment of
Assistant to Duverney, the celebrated anatomist, who at
that period, despite his advanced age (eighty years), was
still actively engaged in research work. Two years later,
upon Duverney’s death, Demours was invited to accept the
associated positions of Demonstrator and Custodian of the
Cabinet of Natural History at the Jardin du Roi. He had
occupied these positions only a short time when Jean-Louis
Petit, the celebrated French surgeon, who had observed the
excellent character of the work performed by Demours,
advised him to direct his studies more particularly to the
anatomy and maladies of the eyes. Demours was quite
ready to accept this advice, and thus it came about that in a
few years he acquired considerable reputation as a successful
practitioner in affections of the eye, a reputation which
he continued to hold up to the time of his death on June 26,
1795.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the contributions which Demours made to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>literature of ophthalmology the following deserve to receive
special mention:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Letter to Petit giving the report of an eye complication that
developed as the result of an inoculation with the virus of small-pox;
together with an account of some new observations relating to
the anatomy of the eye and a few general comments on diseases of
that organ; Paris, 1767.</p>

<p class='c018'>A new series of remarks upon certain features in the anatomy of
the cornea; Paris, 1770.</p>

<p class='c018'>Observations on the structure of the <i>corpus vitreum</i>; Paris, 1741.</p>

<p class='c018'>Observations on the cornea; Paris, 1741.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dissertation on the mechanism of the movements of the pupil
and on certain characteristics of the <i>fibrae rectae</i> of the uvea, in
“<i>Mémoires des Savans Étrangers</i>,” tome II.; and the following
articles in the “<i>Journal de Médecine</i>” edited by Vandermonde:
“On an affection of the eyes which sometimes develops after a perfectly
faultless cataract operation (extraction),” in tome XVI.;
“Reply to Monsieur Descemet’s article on the cartilaginous layer
of the cornea,” in tomes XXXI. and XXXIII.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jean Descemet</span>, born at Paris on April 20, 1732, was the
pupil and friend of Duhamel-Dumonceau, one of the greatest
teachers of that period and an enthusiastic scientist, but
not a physician. Vicq-d’Azyr says that the list of the papers
which he published during his lifetime (he was eighty-two
years old at the time of his death) is very long and reveals
the fact that he was interested in a great variety of topics,
the majority of them relating to commerce, the arts, vegetable
physiology, agriculture, and marine questions. To
Descemet the influence of such a powerful mind, so enthusiastic
and yet so precise in all its operations, could not fail
to have been very great, and one of its earliest effects was
to lead him to take a strong interest in botany and in anatomical
research work. His graduation thesis, which—in
accordance with the prevailing custom—he publicly defended
early in 1758, dealt with the subject of the minute
anatomy of the cornea and the lens. As the investigations
which he made in regard to these important structures were
strictly original, the scientific authorities accorded to him
the honor of having his name attached to the membrane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>which lines the internal face of the transparent cornea, and
which at the same time envelopes the aqueous humor. The
reason why this membrane was selected by preference was
this: Descemet was believed to have been the first person to
describe in great detail this previously unknown structure.
Demours, in 1767, published an article in which he claimed
that the honor of this discovery belonged to him and not to
Descemet. I cannot pretend to decide upon the justice of
this claim; but, so far as I am able to learn, nobody has in
modern times seriously disputed the propriety of retaining
the name “Descemet’s membrane.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Descemet was held in high esteem by all his associates in
the Paris Faculty of Medicine. He was generally recognized
by the medical men of France to be a skilled anatomist
and a careful and trustworthy observer. The various offices
which he held at one time or another in the course of his
active life give further proof of the correctness of the estimate
which I have furnished of this admirable French
physician. His death occurred at Paris in 1810.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among his published writings the following deserve to
receive special mention:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>An sola lens crystallina cataractae sedes?</i>”—Paris, 1758.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Catalogues of the garden plants cultivated by the apothecaries
of Paris,” Paris, 1759.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mémoire et observations sur la choroïde, etc.,” in “<i>Mémoires
des Savans Étrangers de l’Academie Royale des Sciences</i>,” tome V.,
1768.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the last-named article valuable information is furnished
with regard to the membrane which bears his name.
Here, for instance, is revealed the fact that with advancing
age the attachment of the membrane to the cornea gradually
becomes less firm until finally, at the age of about sixty, it
becomes completely detached.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jacques Delpech</span> was born at Toulouse, in the south-western
part of France, in 1772. After he had completed
his preliminary studies at Toulouse he went to Montpellier,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>took the regular course in medicine at the university, and
was given the degree of Doctor in Surgery in 1801. While
residing in that city he acted as an <i>Officier de Santé</i> in one
of the military hospitals. The following year he was given
the position of Instructor in Anatomy at the Toulouse
Medical School, which at that period bore the title of “<i>Société
de Médecine et de Pharmacie</i>.” It was here that he
first manifested his great gifts as a teacher, his success in
this respect being truly remarkable. In 1812 he offered
himself, along with several other competitors, as a candidate
for the chair of clinical surgery in the Faculty of the
Montpellier Medical School, and was given this coveted
position. It should be stated, however, that previous to this
event, for a period of several years following his brief service
as an instructor in anatomy at Toulouse, he had devoted
himself with great zeal and thoroughness to the study
of surgery in Paris, and was therefore specially well prepared
for this competitive test. In the new field in which,
from this time forward to the end of his career, he worked
with unflagging enthusiasm, Delpech had ample opportunity
to show to the world his great talents as a teacher of
surgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was one branch of surgical work in which he took
a greater interest than in all the others, made many ingenious
discoveries, and thus gained great distinction; I refer
to the pathology and treatment of deformities, the science
of orthopedics. He not only built up a large practice in
cases of this nature, but he also wrote a valuable treatise
on the subject. This work, which was published in Paris in
1828–1829, bears the title: “<i>De l’Orthomorphie, par Rapport
à l’Espèce Humaine, ou Recherches Anatomico-Pathologiques
sur les Causes, les Moyens de Prévenir, Ceux de
Guérir les Principales Difformités, et sur les Véritables
Fondemens de l’Art Appelé Orthopédique</i>.” It is, briefly
stated, a complete treatise on the pathology and treatment
of deformities of the human frame, one of the first (possibly
the very first) of its kind published in a modern language.
From statements which he makes in the course of
his text it appears that Delpech recognized at an early date
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>that it is upon the muscles surrounding a joint that its
solidity is chiefly dependent, and consequently that all
lesions involving the muscular apparatus in the neighborhood
of a joint are very potent factors in the causation of
deformities. In addition, he states that the absence of
exact fitting of two opposite articular surfaces, one upon
the other, during the period of development of the skeleton,
constitutes another and very important cause of deformities
both in the limbs and in the trunk. To these general
causes, he says, there may be added the following: muscular
debility, the effects produced by certain attitudes of the
body, by the paralysis and also by the contractures of certain
muscles, by the effects of rheumatism, by softening of
the bones, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other sections of the treatise he discusses in a most
practical and interesting manner the subjects of diagnosis
and treatment of deformities. In the remarkable orthopedic
hospital which he established in Montpellier he treated,
with enthusiasm and untiring faithfulness, large numbers
of patients suffering from deformities of all sorts, thus
gaining a wide experience in this particular class of cases,
and constantly increasing his skill in treating them successfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the earlier years of his practice Delpech also published
an important paper on the subject of hospital gangrene,
under the title: “<i>Mémoire sur la Complication des Plaies
et des Ulcères, Connue sous le Nom de ‘Pourriture d’Hôpital’</i>”;
Paris, 1815. This memoir is esteemed by his
biographer to be the best treatise that had been written on
hospital gangrene up to the year 1834.</p>

<p class='c007'>Delpech, says his biographer, will always be classed as
one of the most distinguished professors of the Medical
School of Montpellier during the early part of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 28th of October, 1832, he was assassinated by a
merchant of Bordeaux upon whom he had operated for
varicocele during the preceding year, and who, immediately
after killing his victim, destroyed his own life.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span><span class='sc'>Pierre Fauchard, A. Jourdain and J. B. Gariot.</span>—Although
it is the general belief that dentistry did not become
a separate and independent branch of surgical practice
until a comparatively recent date, there is nevertheless
some evidence that efforts were made by certain surgeons,
many years ago, to engage in this special field of work. The
earliest record of this fact, so far as I have been able to
discover, is furnished by Francis Gribble in his book entitled:
“Lake Geneva and its Literary Landmarks.” According
to his statement a dentist, toward the end of the sixteenth
century, applied to the Governing Body of Geneva,
Switzerland, for permission to settle in that city and practice
his profession. As the civic authorities, however, did
not appear to comprehend just how much risk, either to the
bodies or to the souls of the Genevese, was involved in
granting the desired permission, they referred the question
to Théodore de Bèze, the great theologist, who, in the temporary
absence of John Calvin, was acting as the Syndic
or Mayor of the city. We are not told by Gribble how the
matter was at last decided, but there can be scarcely any
doubt that the dentist was finally permitted to hang out his
shingle and go to work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The explorations made among the ruins of ancient Egypt
show that even at that remote period, three or four hundred
years before the Christian Era, there were men who
knew how to fill carious cavities in human teeth and to perform
other surgical acts which call for the skill and knowledge
of the practical dentist. But the discovery of such
isolated facts does not demonstrate clearly that dentistry
was practiced at that early period as a special department
of the surgical art; and, furthermore, many centuries after
that date elapsed before there was discovered any further
evidence that dentistry had survived during the long intervening
period. In fact, the records do not throw much light
on this subject until we reach the seventeenth century.
Then it appears that a certain Alexandre Poteler, during
the latter part of that century, attained considerable celebrity,
in France, as a skilful and experienced dental surgeon.
Further details concerning this man are lacking.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Sprengel, in his history of medicine, mentions the names
of several men—Germans, French and English—who during
the early part of the eighteenth century occasionally
performed operations in the field of dentistry, but among
this number I find only three who appear to have attained
eminence in their special line of work—viz., Pierre Fauchard,
A. Jourdain, and J. B. Gariot. I will furnish here
the few details which I have been able to obtain concerning
the career of these men.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pierre Fauchard</span> was born in France toward the end of
the seventeenth century. After receiving the regular training
of a physician he entered the service of the Royal Navy,
ultimately attaining the rank of Surgeon-Major. Subsequently,
having first taken a special course of instruction
under Alexandre Poteler, he settled at Paris and practiced
dentistry in that city for a period of more than fifty years.
During the course of his career he published a treatise on
the surgery of the mouth, and in the preparation of this
work he received efficient aid from Jean Devaux (1649–1729),
one of the most learned surgeons of his time in
France. This treatise, according to the testimony of his
biographer, contains many reports of cases which were
observed by Fauchard in actual practice; and, he adds, the
book still possesses considerable value as a work of reference.
Among the unusual pathological conditions described
and occasionally pictured the following deserve to receive
special mention:—“Abscess or Softening of the Dental
Pulp without Recognizable Alteration of the Cortical Substance”
(relief was obtained by trephining the tooth);
“Defective Teeth of Many Different Kinds,” and the
proper manner of remedying such defects, both in cases
where only a part of the tooth is defective, and also in those
where it is found necessary to supply an entire tooth or
even several teeth; “On the Art of Remedying Defects in
the Palate”; “On the More Extensive Employment of Lead
Fillings, etc.” The treatise here referred to bears the following
title: “<i>Le Chirurgien Dentiste, ou Traité des Dents</i>,
etc.,” with 40 engraved plates; 2 vols., Paris, 1728; a second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>edition, which was published in 1746, contains many important
additions.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Anselme-Louis-Bernard-Brechillet Jourdain</span>, who was
born in Paris, November 28, 1734, was one of the most distinguished
French physicians of the eighteenth century who
devoted himself largely to the study and practice of dentistry.
He was also interested in medical science generally,
having acted for several years as an associate editor of the
<i>Journal de Médecine</i>. Among the treatises which he wrote
on topics relating to dentistry the following deserve to

furnish very scanty information concerning his professional

that he published a treatise which bears the following title:

</div>

<p class='c005'>The two most distinguished military surgeons in Europe
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were Desgenettes
and Baron Larrey, both of them natives of France.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Aimé-Nicolas Dufriche Desgenettes</span> was born at Alençon,
France, in 1762. His early medical training was obtained
at the University of Montpellier, and the degree of
Doctor of Medicine was bestowed upon him in 1789. Four
years later he entered the French military service and participated
in the campaign of Egypt and Syria, during which
he rapidly rose to the position of Chief Physician in that
part of the army which was officially designated as the
Army of Italy. In 1802, after the close of the campaign, he
was appointed First Physician of the Military Hospital at
Paris, and at the same time was given the position of General
Inspector of the Health Department of the Armies.
From that time to the year 1814 he visited, in his official
capacity, Russia, Prussia and Spain; and amid scenes of
carnage and destruction he never failed to display the
character of a high-minded physician, a benevolent and
guardian spirit. His career as a medical officer was largely
that of a man of action, who exhibited at the same time a
keen sympathy for those who stood in need of his services.
To quote the words of his biographer, “he extended his
cares to the sick of all nations,—to the Turk and the Christian,
to the men of the South as well as to those of the
North, and, as disinterested also as the Great Hippocrates,
he retired poor from his labors, though he might easily have
made himself rich. Often placed in opposition to military
power and faction, he always exhibited an unwavering
inflexibility and energy of character. His thorough knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>of men and things, his skill in the practice of his art,
and his vigorous and unbending mind distinguished him
for more than twenty years at the head of the medical service
of the French armies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This splendid showing, I venture to remark, could
scarcely have been realized if Bonaparte had not been
endowed with two admirable traits of character. In the
first place, he seemed to possess almost infallibly correct
judgment in his choice of men who were to act as generals
or as chief surgeons of his various armies; and then, in the
second place, he was in the habit of supporting these men
loyally whenever, later on in their career, disputes arose
as to the wisdom or patriotic purpose of their decisions.
The history of the wars that occurred from 1793 to 1814,
between France and the different European nations which
opposed her, abounds in instances that confirm the truth
of what I have just stated. Corvisart, it is also highly
probable, deserves much of the credit for Bonaparte’s loyal
treatment of his chief army surgeons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The biographer of Desgenettes relates two occurrences
which throw additional light upon the nobility of character
of this admirable physician. These occurrences are briefly
narrated as follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'>A contagious disease appeared in the Army of the East and
spread rapidly from one man to another. The soldiers were struck
with terror and despair, and were ready to die, merely because they
considered death imminent and inevitable.... Monsieur Desgenettes
assured them that the hideous buboes with which they were
covered were not symptoms of the plague, and he proved it. How?
By the following heroic experiment. He took the matter of these
buboes and inoculated himself in the presence of the soldiers. This
proof was conclusive in their eyes, hope was again kindled in their
bosoms, and the mortality diminished. Here is one of those brilliant
actions which history delights to preserve and transmit from
age to age.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>DESGENETTES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>On another occasion Desgenettes manifested equally
great courage. The occurrence is narrated by his biographer
in these words:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Made prisoner in the retreat from Russia, he demanded boldly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>his liberty, not as a favor, but as a right; he invoked the sacredness
of his ministry and in particular the cares which he had lavished
alike on the Russians and on the French. An imperial ukase immediately
rendered him his liberty. The Emperor Alexander called
him into his presence and expressed to him his sentiments of high
esteem and regard. He received soon after from Sweden the order
of the Polar Star.</p>

<p class='c019'>Desgenettes’ death occurred in 1837. He made no contributions
to medical literature; and his enemies brought
against him the charge that, when he delivered a lecture, he
spoiled it by telling too many anecdotes about the different
wars in which he took part.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jean-Dominique Larrey</span> was born in 1776 at Baudéan,
a French village at the foot of the Pyrenees. At the age of
thirteen years, shortly after the death of his father, he
quitted his native village and came under the care of his
uncle, Alexis Larrey, who was Surgeon-Major and Professor
at the Hospital of Grave, near Toulouse. Under the
wise and kindly guidance of the latter he pursued his
studies so earnestly and with such intelligence that he was
able, on attaining his twentieth year, to pass successfully
the examinations required for an appointment to the position
of Assistant Surgeon in the French Navy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sloop-of-war “<i>La Vigilante</i>,” the vessel in which he
gained his first experience in the naval service, met with
disaster and Larrey was nearly shipwrecked. As soon as
possible after this thrilling experience he went to Paris
and took service in the great Hospital of Hôtel-Dieu, under
the orders of the famous surgeon Desault. This was at the
beginning of the severe winter of 1789, an eventful time
in the history of France. The Revolution was now in full
swing, and Larrey not only was an eye-witness of the
troubles which characterized its early stages, but he also
had the opportunity, under the orders of Desault, to render
professional service to the first victims of those tragic days.
Three years afterward, while serving in the Army of the
Rhine, under the command of Marshal Luckner, he was
able to put to good use all the admirable surgical training
which he had received under Desault at the Hôtel-Dieu.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>When Larrey was about twenty-one years old and while
he was attached to that part of the French Army which was
then stationed in the vicinity of Milan and Venice, he interested
himself actively in the establishment of an army
ambulance service. Already three or four years earlier he
had become sensible of the inconveniences of the French
ambulances which were then in use. In the first place, these
vehicles were of such a type as to be ill-suited to the work
which they were intended to perform; they were too heavy
to be driven with reasonable speed to and from the battlefield,
and they were also so rigidly constructed that at every
irregularity in the ground over which the wheels passed
the wounded soldier experienced a painful jolt. Then, in
the second place, aside from the faulty construction of these
vehicles, the regulations governing their management were
so badly planned as to leave the wounded lying unaided on
the battlefield sometimes for several hours together. It
was customary, for example, to station the ambulances at
a spot about three miles distant from the troops who were
shortly to engage in combat, and they were not despatched
to the battlefield until after the fighting had ended. In this
way hours often elapsed before the wounded could receive
any aid whatever from the surgeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In working out a solution of this complex problem Larrey’s
very practical mind quickly reached certain conclusions:
first, that it was most important to remove the
wounded from the battlefield to a place of safety much
earlier than had hitherto been the custom; and, second, that
the type of ambulance then universally employed was altogether
too heavy and too rigid to serve well the purposes
for which it was needed. He realized fully that this last
part of the problem was the more important part, and that,
if he could invent a less ponderous and at the same time
more elastic vehicle for use as the field ambulance, he would
by this very act be placed in a position where he could
effect in a large measure a solution of the second half of
the problem.</p>

<div id='i244'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i244.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>BARON LARREY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Larrey promptly set about the work of providing a new
type of field ambulance and in a short time was successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>in obtaining a most useful vehicle for the purpose. It is
described by his biographer in the following words:—</p>

<p class='c017'>This invention of Larrey’s was a kind of carriage hung on
springs, uniting great strength and solidity with lightness. Such
indeed was its lightness that it was able to follow all the movements
of the advance guard with as much speed as flying artillery. These
<i>ambulances volantes</i>, as they were called, were first used by the
French in a defile of the Rhine near Koenigstein. Here the ambulances
invented by the talented and benevolent French surgeon bore
the wounded rapidly away from the neighborhood of the enemy
instead of leaving them either to die or to sustain a protracted
agony on the field of battle.</p>

<p class='c019'>In this work of inventing a field ambulance of a greatly
improved pattern Larrey revealed an exceptionally fine
trait of character, viz., a strong desire to utilize his talents
and the opportunities afforded by his official position for
the benefit of his fellow men, both the wounded of the
French army and those of the enemy forces. He revealed
the same trait in many other ways—as, for instance, when
he took infinite pains, after a battle, to provide proper shelter,
food and care for the wounded in the town or village
nearest to the site of the conflict, and that too in a part of
the country which belonged to the enemy. He revealed it
again in the fighting which took place in Eastern Prussia
and in the course of the numerous retreats which Napoleon’s
army was forced to make in the Russian campaign.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the incidents which occurred during that long and
disastrous retreat of the remnants of Napoleon’s army
from Moscow there was one which reveals in a very clear
light the high sense of duty that characterized Larrey’s
actions as Surgeon-in-Chief of the French Army and the
complete faith which the individual soldiers composing that
army—or at least the better disposed among them—placed
in his disinterested and loyal service in their behalf. The
incident to which I have reference occurred while the disorganized
French troops were crossing the Beresina River
and is thus described by Larrey’s biographer:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The Russian general arrived at the head of 50,000 men and began
the fire among the division of General Partonneaux, the soldiers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>which division immediately wished to cross the Bridge all at once.
The conveyances collided with one another, and some of the unfortunate
men were crushed, while others, losing all spirit, threw themselves
into the stream.... There was throughout a frightful mixture
of imprecations, of clashings, and of strugglings, whence arose
indescribable disorder and a breaking of the overloaded bridge.
The Russian Army approached, and with its formidable artillery
tore the ranks of the French mob of soldiers.... In this immense
disaster what had become of the distinguished Surgeon-in-Chief
of the Grand Army? After having crossed over the Beresina with
the Imperial Guard, he discovered that requisites for the sick and
wounded of his countrymen had been left on the opposite bank.
With equal humanity and heroism, he recrossed the river, and
hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by a wildly excited
crowd. He was almost suffocated in the midst of it.... No sooner
was he recognized than he was carried back with great rapidity in
the arms of the soldiers across the river. On all parts was heard
the cry, in nearly these words, “Let us save him who saved us!”
The soldiers almost forgot their own safety in their desire to preserve
an officer whose tender kindness they had so often experienced.</p>

<p class='c019'>I believe that I have now shown with sufficient fulness of
detail what were the prominent characteristics of Larrey
as a man and as an executive army medical officer. It still
remains for me to furnish some evidence of the excellent
judgment which he displayed in his work as a practical
surgeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one of the French hospitals, during the war, Larrey’s
attention was called to a Russian soldier who had been shot
in the forehead by an iron ball weighing 217 grammes.
This projectile had pierced the frontal bone above and a
little to the outside of the right eyebrow, and had penetrated
into the interior of the skull. Despite the bulk of
this iron ball, the opening which was perceptible in the bone
did not exceed six or eight millimeters in diameter, and, by
introducing a small probe, one might feel the ball. The
smallness of the opening in the bone, says Larrey, may be
explained by the elasticity of the osseous fibres, some of
which the ball would have to push aside in order completely
to penetrate the outer table of the frontal bone, and which
consequently would yield instead of fracturing. In the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>case the bony angles at the edge of the circular opening
were cut away by the surgeon and the opening itself was
made large enough to permit the removal of the ball by
means of an elevator and pincers. A great quantity of
coagulated blood and some small fragments of bone were
then evacuated. The brain itself presented at this spot a
depression of about seven millimeters in depth. In a short
period of time the wound healed, and apparently complete
recovery followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to judge correctly of the credit which rightfully
belongs to Larrey for his successful treatment of this case
of gunshot wound of the skull and underlying brain, one
must remember that in the early part of the nineteenth
century it was considered a very bold surgical act to operate
upon the injured brain, and particularly so in the almost
complete absence of adequate surgical equipment.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an instance of Larrey’s quickness in meeting an emergency
I will narrate here very briefly an experience which
he had at Smolensk, Russia. When the French troops
entered that city, after a severe battle, they found that the
inhabitants had already fled, owing in part to the fact that
many of their dwellings had been destroyed by fire. Larrey,
as soon as was practicable, converted fifteen of the largest
buildings which had not been devastated by the flames, into
hospitals for the wounded. Unfortunately, all supplies or
stores of any kind had either been destroyed by the enemy
or removed by them in their orderly and premeditated
retreat. For the large number of wounded there was a deficiency
of linen and splints; but Larrey discovered a store of
archives in one of the buildings which had escaped the fire,
and he promptly substituted sheets of paper for linen and
utilized the thick parchment covers for splints. He toiled
with little intermission night and day, and the French surgeons
generally, in imitation of their chief, were indefatigable
in their attention to the wounded, who were about 10,000
in number.</p>

<p class='c007'>Las Cases, in his “Memorial of St. Helena,” published
after he had returned to Europe, reports Napoleon as having
uttered the following words on October 23, 1816: “What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>a man, what a brave and worthy man is Larrey! What care
was given by him to the army in Egypt and everywhere!
I have conceived for him the highest esteem. If the army
were to raise a column to the memory of any one, it should
be to the memory of Larrey. He has left in my mind the
idea of a truly honest man.” In his will Napoleon wrote:
“I bequeath to the Surgeon-in-Chief of the French Army,
Larrey, 100,000 francs. He is the most virtuous man I have
ever known.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will pardon me, I am sure, if I furnish here
additional proof of Larrey’s sound judgment in questions
of a purely surgical nature. He insisted, for example, on
the importance of promptly resorting to amputation in
cases where the gunshot wound had caused a complicated
fracture of the bone or had inflicted serious destruction of
the soft parts; and he particularly recommended this course
of action in the case of individuals who were cachectic or
below par. He expressed himself in favor of the circular
incision in preference to that which was intended to furnish
flaps. (From “<i>Mémoire sur les Amputations, etc.</i>,” Paris,
1797.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In another place Larrey mentions, somewhat in detail,
the reasons why primary amputations are to be given the
preference in military surgery. They are the following:—</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) The inconvenience which attends the transportation of the
wounded from the field of battle to the military hospitals on badly
constructed carriages; the jarring of these wagons produces such
disorder in the wounds and in all the nerves, that the greater part
of the wounded perish on the way, especially if it be long, and the
heat or cold of the weather be extreme.</p>

<p class='c018'>(2) The danger of remaining long in the hospitals. This risk
is much diminished by amputation; it converts a gunshot wound
into one which is capable of being speedily healed, and obviates
the causes that produce the hospital fever and gangrene.</p>

<p class='c018'>(3) In case the wounded are of necessity abandoned on the field
of battle: In this event it is important that amputation should
have been performed, because—when it is completed—they [the
wounded] may remain several days without being dressed, and the
subsequent dressings are more easily accomplished. Moreover, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>often happens that these unfortunate persons do not find surgeons
sufficiently skilful to operate, as we have seen among some nations
whose military hospitals were not organized like ours. (From Vol.
2 of Larrey’s “Memoirs of Military Surgery.”)</p>

<p class='c019'>(In judging the quality of the advice given here the
reader should not overlook the fact that it was pronounced
in the early part of the nineteenth century.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Larrey’s death occurred on July 24, 1842. A few years
previous to this date he had received the title of Baron.</p>

    <div><span class='large'>HOSPITAL OF “LA MATERNITÉ,” THE GREAT FRENCH MIDWIFERY SCHOOL</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>John Cross, the author of an excellent memoir entitled
“Sketches of the Medical Schools of Paris,” has written
such a full and satisfactory account of <i>la Maternité</i> and its
admirable teaching machinery that I shall not hesitate to
use it freely as my guide in preparing this and the following
chapters. I am the more ready to adopt this course because,
first, I have had no personal experience whatever with this
department of medical science, and, second, because Dr.
Cross’ account is not compiled from the writings of other
physicians, but is based upon his own personal observations
and upon information which he derived at first hand from
Monsieur Chaussier, the Physician-in-Chief of the hospital.
Here is what he writes (1815) upon this important
subject:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The midwifery department of <i>l’Hôpital de la Maternité</i> is converted
to an admirable purpose by being made a school for the
educating of <i>Sages-Femmes</i> (midwives); and I was not a little surprised
at my first entering this hospital with Monsieur Chaussier,
the Physician-in-Chief, to find the wards crowded with female students.
This midwifery-school was founded about twelve years ago
(about 1803), since which time young women have come annually
from all parts of France to study there. Some pursue their education
at their own expense; but most of them are chosen by the
<i>Prefets</i> of the different <i>Départements</i> of France or by the governors
of country hospitals, by whom all expenses are paid. For six-hundred
francs these women are lodged, boarded and educated, during
one year. They reside in the hospital, and cannot go out of its
precincts without permission. After a twelve-months residence and
an examination, they receive their diplomas from <i>l’École de Médecine</i>—or
the <i>Faculté de Médecine</i>—to practice as midwives....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>They follow the Physician and Surgeon in their daily visits, and
each pupil makes a clinical report in writing of the patients under
her care. The accuracy and minuteness of some of these reports,
presented to Monsieur Chaussier during his visit, could not have
been greater if they had been made by an experienced practitioner....</p>

<p class='c018'>During the first five years of the existence of this <i>École d’Accouchement</i>,
nearly five-hundred well-educated women were sent to
practice midwifery in different parts of France.... In June,
1814, the month in which the new students are admitted, and those
who have finished their education are dismissed, one-hundred and
thirty, who had followed the lectures and practice of midwifery at
<i>la Maternité</i> during the preceding year, were examined, and
received certificates of their being qualified to practice as <i>accoucheuses</i>....
Monsieur Baudelocque was, to the time of his death,
a zealous promoter of this school of midwifery, and a copy of his
catechism <i>sur les Accouchements</i> is given to each pupil as soon as
she is admitted. This school is an institution which, from the
novelty and excellence of the plan, the manner in which it is
carried on, and the benefits that must spring from it to society, does
honor to the country which has founded and supported it....
<i>Les Élèves Sages-Femmes</i> who reside for twelve months at <i>l’Hôpital
de la Maternité</i>, and about whose instruction so much pains are
taken and so much attention bestowed by the medical men attached
to it, are, there can be little doubt, quite as good practitioners at the
completion of their education, as the male students in midwifery in
any country.</p>

<p class='c019'>What is here written by Dr. Cross refers to the condition
of <i>la Maternité</i> as he found it in 1815,—that is, after the
institution had been in successful operation for nearly if
not quite twenty years. To go back to the time when it was
first organized I should state that, upon the breaking up
and disorganization of the <i>Faculté de Médecine</i> and the
<i>École de Chirurgie</i>, there was erected, upon the ruins of
these, <i>l’École de Santé</i>, in which Baudelocque was given the
place of Professor of Obstetrics; and at the same time he
was appointed “Surgeon-in-Chief and Accoucheur” of the
recently established <i>Maternité</i>. From the very first both
the general public and the great majority of physicians
reposed almost absolute confidence in Baudelocque, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>consequently it is not strange that he was the guiding spirit
in the development of this important hospital and training
school.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sprengel, the author of one of the earliest and best histories
of medicine, gives unlimited praise to Baudelocque
for the clearness, practical character and conciseness of his
writings on the subject of midwifery. His treatise on obstetrics,
he adds, is decidedly superior to that of the English
surgeon, Thomas Denman, whose writings, which cover the
same field, were published at about the same period of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the details of the management of <i>la Maternité</i>, the
mortality experienced, the number of infants born, etc....
I must refer the reader to Dr. Cross’ memoir, in which he
gives, in addition, an account of the somewhat similar work
done at the famous Dublin Lying-in Hospital. There remain,
however, a number of interesting details concerning
the life and career of Baudelocque which cannot well be
omitted from this sketch, and I will therefore proceed at
once to supply them here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professional jealousy, which seems to have existed in
those days in a particularly virulent form, left Baudelocque
very little peace of mind and undermined his health to a
serious degree. One of the most striking experiences of
this nature is the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>A certain Dr. Sacombe set out to increase his reputation—or,
rather, to gain notoriety for himself—by attacking
violently all those physicians who sanctioned the operation
of Caesarian section as permissible in certain cases; and,
inasmuch as Baudelocque was the most distinguished one
among these physicians, he directed his most violent efforts
against him. There having recently occurred, in the latter’s
practice, a case of tedious labor in which it had been
found necessary to remove the head of the foetus by amputation,
Dr. Sacombe intimated that Baudelocque in this
instance had been guilty of what apparently amounted to a
double murder. Both public opinion and the courts were
very prompt in judging this to be an infamous calumny on
the part of the accuser. Although Baudelocque was completely
exonerated from the charge, he nevertheless suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>keenly from the brutality of this attack upon his
character. In fact, it was believed that the cerebral affection
from which he died on May 2, 1810, was brought on by
the worry which was associated with Dr. Sacombe’s attack.
Shortly before his death the news reached him that he had
been chosen to take charge of the <i>Accouchement</i> of the Empress,
Marie Louise, but even this vindication failed to be
of any benefit at that late hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two most important treatises published by Baudelocque
are the following: “<i>Principes de l’Art par Réponses,
en Faveur des Élèves Sages-Femmes</i>,” Paris, 1775. This
work was written entirely for the guidance of midwives,
the Government purchasing 6000 copies. “<i>l’Art des Accouchements</i>,”
Paris, 1781, 2 vols. Later editions were published
in 1789, 1796, 1807, 1815 and 1822. Baudelocque also
published a number of memoirs and reports of cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success of <i>la Maternité</i> as the great French Lying-in
Hospital and Training School for Midwives was probably
as much due to the wise and painstaking management of
the widow Lachapelle as to the skill and great experience
of Baudelocque. It is therefore only fitting that I should
give here a brief biographic sketch of this admirable
woman.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Veuve Lachapelle</span>, whose maiden name was Marie-Louise
Dugès, was born at Paris on January 1, 1769. Her
mother, Marie Jonet, was at first a sworn midwife (“<i>Sage-Femme
Jurée</i>”) at the Chatelet Hospital, but later (1775)
she was promoted to the position of Midwife-in-Chief of
Hôtel-Dieu, the largest hospital in Paris. Madame Jonet
made her home in Hôtel-Dieu, and she performed the duties
of her very responsible office with such zeal, such conspicuous
ability, and such faithfulness that the Government
awarded her, when she retired after a long service, a liberal
pension. The daughter Marie, who had been brought up
with great care under the constant supervision of her
mother, and who had lived from day to day as it were in
the midst of pregnant women and women actually undergoing
confinement, absorbed unconsciously a great deal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>information, both theoretical and practical, concerning the
art of midwifery. Although she married, in 1792, Monsieur
Lachapelle, the Resident Surgeon of the Hôpital Saint-Louis,
she continued her residence at Hôtel-Dieu, with her
mother, to whom she was strongly attached; and after the
death of her husband, which occurred not long after they
had been married, this attachment rather increased.
Madame Lachapelle, who from this time onward was known
as <i>Veuve Lachapelle</i>, showed such a keen interest in her
work and performed all her hospital duties with such skill
and such excellent judgment that in 1795 the Government
appointed her the Associate Chief Midwife of Hôtel-Dieu.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a somewhat later date, during the administration of
Minister Chaptal, the Maternité Hospital was organized,
and Madame Lachapelle was made the Resident Directress
of the new institution. Baudelocque was appointed Surgeon-in-Chief
and Professor of Obstetrics, and Madame
Lachapelle was given the position, under him, of Instructress
in Midwifery. François Chaussier, Baudelocque’s
successor and one of the most distinguished French physicians
of that period, declared that Madame Lachapelle was
a most successful teacher of the art of midwifery, and added
that her usefulness in this field extended far beyond the
period of her active connection with the Maternité Hospital;
for she had made a regular practice, during her residence
in that institution, of keeping an immense number of
carefully prepared records of the cases which came under
her observation, and these, which form the basis of the volumes
published after her death, by her nephew, constitute—as
Chaussier believes—a most useful work of reference,
second in value only to the great work of Baudelocque.</p>

<p class='c007'>Veuve Lachapelle’s death occurred on October 4, 1821.

<p class='c014'>FURTHER DETAILS CONCERNING THE PARIS
FACULTÉ DE MÉDECINE AND CONCERNING
SOME OF THE LARGER HOSPITALS OF PARIS</p>
<p class='c005'>The present chapter is intended to supply, in as condensed
a form as possible, some of the facts relating to the
growth of the Paris School of Medicine, and also information
concerning one or two of the larger hospitals of Paris.
As such details are not likely to possess interest for more
than a comparatively small number of my readers I unhesitatingly
advise all others to skip this chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Medical Schools<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> of the <i>Rue de la Bûcherie</i>,” says
Chereau, “are still in existence to-day (1866), although
somewhat altered in appearance. They stand at the angle
formed by the Rue de la Bûcherie and the Rue de l’Hôtel
Colbert. These buildings, however, masquerade under singular
forms. Since the day when our fathers in medicine
abandoned the Temple of Aesculapius (1775) it has been
put to a great variety of uses, such as a public <i>lavoir</i>, a tap
room, a <i>cabaret</i> where thieves meet, rooms equipped each
with a number of beds, and a <i>lupanar</i>, where the fee charged
was twenty sous a sitting; the room in which Riolan taught
anatomy converted into a low-down billiard saloon; the
ground over which Femel walked, soaked with all sorts of
nasty fluids; the office in which sat the employés of the
school—those vigilant guardians of the rights and dignity
of the Faculty—plastered with police ordinances; the
chapel, in which the doctors were wont piously to attend
mass, now occupied as a miserable lodging-house; etc.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1808 the <i>Faculté de Médecine</i> was given the splendid
quarters of the <i>Collège de l’Académie de Chirurgie</i>, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>it is still to-day located. Clinical instruction was carried on
at Hôtel-Dieu, La Charité and certain other hospitals. The
school itself is no longer called “<i>l’École de Médecine</i>,” but
“<i>la Faculté de Médecine</i>,” and the old building, suitably
modified, has been preserved—not as a part of the present
school, but as a sort of clubroom or social hall for the use
of all the university students. (See accompanying illustrations
facing page <a href='#i260a'>260</a>.)</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Écoles de Santé.</span>—When the statement was made before
the Convention that the Army of the Republic had lost
about 600 medical officers, and that the troops in the eastern
Pyrenees were almost entirely without physicians and surgeons,
a law was passed (December 4, 1794) authorizing
the organization at Paris, Montpellier and Strassburg, of
three medical institutes or secondary medical schools (designated
as “<i>Écoles de Santé</i>”). They were originally intended
to be simply temporary organizations where “<i>officiers
de santé</i>” might be trained for service in the hospitals,—more
particularly the military and naval hospitals. Each
of the <i>Départements</i> of France was entitled to send one
pupil to be educated at one of these military medical
schools, at the expense of the nation, for a period of three
years. In accordance with this scheme Paris received 300
pupils, Montpellier 150, and Strassburg 100. Owing to the
lack of places or schools where young men might, at their
own expense, be trained as physicians, it soon became necessary
to permit men of this class to attend these schools.
And so in 1796 the Medical School at Paris was reorganized
and provision made for the following twelve professorships:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Anatomy and Physiology.</div>
      <div class='line'>Medical Chemistry and Pharmacy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Medical Physics and Hygiene.</div>
      <div class='line'>Surgical Pathology.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pathology of Internal Diseases.</div>
      <div class='line'>Medical Natural History.</div>
      <div class='line'>Operative Surgery.</div>
      <div class='line'>Surgical Clinic.</div>
      <div class='line'>Clinic of Internal Diseases.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Clinic for Final Stage of Students’ Training.</div>
      <div class='line'>Obstetrics.</div>
      <div class='line'>History of Medicine and Medico-Legal Science.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1798 a chair for pathological anatomy was added, and
there were also organized several special clinics—one, for
example, for sexual diseases; and among the names of the
professors who taught at this period are to be found those
of Sabatier, Chopart, Pinel, Corvisart, Baudelocque, Lassus,
and P. A. O. Mahon. The last-named lectured on the
history of medicine. No fees were charged for tuition.
Under this new régime the Paris Medical School rapidly
rose in favor, until in 1799 the attendance had reached the
extraordinary total of 1500. In addition to the regular students
who expected to receive a medical diploma if they
passed a satisfactory examination at the end of the course,
there was a large attendance of quacks, at all three of these
schools (Paris, Montpellier and Strassburg). Neither a
diploma nor any special permit, however, was required of
those who wished to engage in the practice of medicine.
This state of affairs soon led to frightful abuses, and the
Convention accordingly passed a new law (March 10, 1803),
which stated that, for the future, only those who had passed
a satisfactory examination in the fundamental branches
(anatomy, physiology, pathology, materia medica, pharmacy,
chemistry, hygiene, obstetrics, surgery and internal
medicine) would be permitted to engage in practice. The
duration of this course of training was four years, and
the candidate was further required to furnish satisfactory
evidence that he had completed the regular Lyceum course
of studies (equivalent to the undergraduate course at one
of our American Colleges) before he entered upon the
medical course.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>On the plea that the people who dwelt in the country districts
live simpler lives, etc., and consequently are subject
to illnesses of a less complicated nature, there was passed
by the National Convention another law in accordance with
which a lower grade of doctors was created—<i>i.e.</i>, practitioners
who were called <i>Officiers de Santé</i>. At first these
men were given permission to practice after they had completed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the third year of the regular course of studies, but
later they were absolved from the necessity of taking any
part of the regular course, provided they could show that
they had spent five years in work connected with a hospital
or had been in the service of a regular physician during a
period of six years. Gradually, as the number of the regular
physicians increased and as the country became more
prosperous, the <i>Officiers de Santé</i> diminished in number.
In 1847 there were 7456 such practitioners, but already in
1872 the number had fallen to 4653. On the other hand, the
regular doctors of medicine had increased during the same
period from 10,643 to 10,766.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1864 an attempt was made in the French Parliament
to abolish the institution of <i>Officiers de Santé</i>, but one of the
members, Bonjean, opposed the motion and it fell through.
The argument which he brought forward and which is
quoted by Puschmann, is essentially the following:—</p>

<p class='c017'>When simple people belonging to the poorer class of the community
are taken ill they want a physician who is himself simple
and poor like themselves, a man who is able to comprehend the language
and the needs of his modest patients, and who, because of
his low birth, because of the fact that he has been habituated from
early childhood to the plain and simple living of the peasant’s cottage,
and also because he has been put to comparatively small
expense to secure the grade which permits him to practice the profession
of medicine, is quite contented to accept a modest fee for
his services. The <i>Officier de Santé</i> is, for all these reasons, admirably
fitted to fulfil his mission of modest devotion; for him, under
these circumstances it will be comparatively easy to act as the confidant,
the counsellor, and the sympathetic friend of the patient.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is not possible for me to state (1919) how far the recent
war has upset all the arrangements mentioned above.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parisian Hospitals.</span>—Of the three large hospitals which
existed in Paris at the beginning of the nineteenth century—the
<i>Hôtel-Dieu</i>, <i>la Charité</i> and <i>la Salpétrière</i>—I am not
able to furnish more than a few scanty details. According
to an editorial which I find in the <i>London Lancet</i> for November 25,
1837, the management of the English hospitals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>destined for the relief of the sick poor during the period
now under consideration was inferior to that of the similar
institutions in France. There are good reasons for believing,
however, that, after the lapse of a few years, the English
hospitals became in every respect the equals of those in
France. In Tenon’s elaborate report on the Parisian hospitals
examined by him in 1816 I find it stated that <i>la Salpétrière</i>
was used in part as a prison and in part as an
asylum for the insane; but, in another part of this report,
he states that at one time this hospital sheltered as many as
8000 persons, the great majority of whom were legitimate
hospital patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> John Cross, in his memoir concerning
medical education in Paris, makes the following remarks:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The patients at <i>l’Hôtel-Dieu</i> vary in number from 1500 to 2000,
and generally approach near to the latter number. Beside the
wards for medical and surgical patients, there is a ward for the
reception of women actually in labor or suffering abortion. The
medical patients are far the most numerous, and eight or nine
physicians are attached to <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i>.... The number of dressers
is not limited; when I was at <i>l’Hôtel-Dieu</i>, above one-hundred were
attached to it.... <i>Les élèves internes</i> of the Parisian hospitals
correspond to our house-surgeons; the number of them to each
hospital is limited, and at <i>l’Hôtel-Dieu</i> there are nearly twenty.
They have their separate apartments in the hospital, are boarded
in it, and have, beside board and lodging, an annual salary of about
twenty guineas each. They may retain their situation for two
years.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Paris possesses a fourth large hospital, which as regards
architectural beauty and the great consideration shown by
the architect for a wise and convenient disposition of the
different available spaces, certainly stands first among the
hospitals of the French capital. I have introduced here a
reduced copy of the plan of this hospital (<i>Hôpital Saint-Louis</i>),
which dates back to the seventeenth century, but,
much as I should like to do so, I am not able to furnish a
description of the details relating to the precise purposes
and the management of the institution at the present time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>It is said to be largely devoted to the treatment of affections

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tenon’s Criticisms on Hôtel-Dieu and Hôpital Saint-Louis.</span>—Speaking
of the wards in the Hôpital Saint-Louis
Tenon, who wrote his treatise in 1786, says that it was a
mistake to make the ceilings only eleven feet high; they
should have been sixteen feet high. He commends strongly
the complete separation of the hospital from the adjacent
city by high surrounding walls. Only one <i>kind</i> of contagion,
he says, should be admitted into any single ward. This
precaution had not previously been observed. In the Hôpital
Saint-Louis the water-closet arrangements were about
as bad as they could possibly be. The same remark applies
to Hôtel-Dieu, where overcrowding was at times scandalously
bad. In the latter hospital there are, in the wards
destined for men, 600 beds—of which number 378 are beds
of the larger size, and 222 of the smaller. In the wards for
women, he adds, the same predominance of large beds exists—viz.,
355 larger beds, 264 of the smaller size.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tenon says emphatically: “Beds for two or more persons
should not be permitted in any hospital. These beds, on
certain occasions, are occupied by four—yes, even by six
persons—and as a result they are infested by vermin. Sleep
is practically unattainable under such circumstances.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

    <div><span class='large'>ARMAND TROUSSEAU, ONE OF THE LAST OF FRANCE’S GREAT CLINICAL TEACHERS</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the preface to his “<i>Bibliothèque de Thérapeutique</i>,”
which was published first in 1828, A. L. J. Bayle says that
the art of treating diseases has been greatly neglected, in
comparison with the enthusiastic efforts made to promote
some of the other branches of the science of medicine, especially
that of pathological anatomy; and, as a result, this
art has in reality actually retrograded. Indeed, he goes
on to say, quite a large number of agents which, up to a
recent date, had been considered efficient remedies, have
been entirely forgotten or even, in some instances, proscribed.
This unfortunate tendency, he adds, may be attributed
to many different causes. One of the most important
of these, he believes, is to be found in the fact that certain
physicians have allowed the idea to take root in their minds
that the lesions which have been discovered in the different
organs of the body at post-mortem examinations were the
cause of the symptoms that, taken in the aggregate, constitute
the particular disease under consideration; and, acting
under the influence of this idea, they have assumed that
their therapeutic efforts should be directed solely to these
lesions. “Experience has not confirmed the correctness of
this theory; on the contrary, it has shown that, if pathological
anatomy is useful to the practitioner, it is chiefly so
because it throws light upon the course and prognosis of
certain diseases, and not because it has furnished a basis
upon which the treatment may be built up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is still another equally strong reason, says Bayle,
why the art of therapeutics has been prevented from making
a satisfactory advance, viz., the propagation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>physiological doctrine (Broussaism), a doctrine which
admits the existence of practically only one disease—<i>irritation</i>,
in its varying degrees of intensity, together with a
single class of remedies—<i>anti-irritants</i>. Modern therapeutists
reject most of these ideas, and experience also shows
that, in the matter of therapeutics, these anti-irritants often
produce harmful results. “A treatise on therapeutics,” he
goes on to say, “should contain the substance of all the good
memoirs that have been published on the treatment of the
different diseases and on the remedies employed; it should
also mention all the circumstances which indicate or contra-indicate
the employment of remedial agents, the best forms
in which the latter may be administered, all the cases in
which they have succeeded in affording relief as well as all
those in which they have failed to accomplish this result;
all the authors who have written on the subject under consideration;
and, finally whatever additional facts may give
the practitioner confidence in the reality of the results
proclaimed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There came under public notice, at about this period of
time, a French physician who evidently held very much the
same beliefs as were put forward by A. L. J. Bayle and
which I have very briefly stated in the preceding paragraph.
I refer to <span class='sc'>Armand Trousseau</span>, who was born (1801)
in Western France, and who received his early medical
training under that prince of physicians, Bretonneau, of
Tours. In association with his friend, Hermann Pidoux,
he published (in two volumes, Paris, 1836–1839) an excellent
treatise on materia medica and therapeutics. The
spirit which guided him in the preparation of this treatise
is well expressed in his own words as follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Medicine is both a science and an art.... It is an art when it
becomes necessary to apply it to a human being who is ill, and this
is especially true when the manner of treatment is under consideration.
It is in this art that the physician reveals how much talent
he possesses; he reveals himself as a true artist by the particular
form of remedial preparation which he decides to administer to his
patient, by the felicitous choice which he makes between remedies,
and by the favorable manner in which he combines them.</p>

<div id='i266'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i266.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>TROUSSEAU</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Dujardin-Beaumetz then adds the important statement
that in his belief Trousseau was—at the time when he gave
utterance to these words—the living personification of the
truth of what he said, for nobody had carried the therapeutic
art to a higher state of perfection than he had. To this
statement may be added, with perfect truth, the opinion
held by many of his contemporaries to the effect that the
publication of the Trousseau-Pidoux treatise promoted
effectively the growth of a sound and trustworthy therapeutic
code. The mere fact that in 1875 this treatise had
already reached its ninth edition furnishes strongly corroborative
proof of the correctness of this opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scantiness of the space which I consider it proper to
devote to this single memoir appears to me to justify the
omission, from this point onward, of everything that does
not add to the description of Trousseau’s career as one of
the greatest clinical teachers in the domain of internal medicine
in France. I am the more strongly impelled to adopt
this course because so many of my personal friends among
the physicians who returned to New York, during the years
1860–1864, spoke in such terms of praise of the success
attained by Trousseau in this particular branch of medical
education.</p>

<p class='c007'>His profound earnestness as a clinical teacher and his
incessant watchfulness over the interests and rights of the
patients who served as material for his bedside lectures
are brought out so clearly in one of his addresses to the
class at the beginning of one of his regular courses that I
shall be pardoned, I am sure, for reproducing it here in
considerable fulness of detail:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Gentlemen:—Before making any remarks to you about my service
at the hospital I feel impelled to tell you what I understand
by the expression ‘clinical instruction’ and to put before you what
I consider to be the respective duties of the professor and of those
who regularly follow his lessons.—It is for me a very pleasant thing,
as you may readily imagine, to see, crowding around the beds in
the ward and seated on the benches of the amphitheatre, a large
number of pupils; but the consciousness that I am fulfilling a
useful mission and am sowing in the minds of these young men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>ideas that will later be fertilized, affords me a much greater pleasure.
However, both as regards the professor and also as regards
the pupils who listen to his teaching, there are needed certain
conditions in the absence of which the clinical instruction must
necessarily prove sterile.</p>

<p class='c018'>Although clinical instruction represents the crowning stage of
your medical studies, I would not have you believe that this particular
part of your medical training should not be begun until you
reach the last period of your student career. From the very day
when a young man decides that he wants to be a physician he should
lose no opportunity of visiting hospitals. It is desirable that he
should see sick people—not occasionally, but as frequently as possible.
The materials which are thus at first stored in one’s memory
in a confused and disorderly condition are nevertheless excellent
materials. While they may not to-day appear to possess a useful
character, you will find them at a later period stored away among
the genuine treasures lodged in your memory. To-day I have
reached the period of old age, and yet I remember distinctly the
patients whom I saw forty-three years ago when I took the very
first steps in my career of physician; I recall the most important
symptoms, the pathological lesions, even in some cases the patient’s
name or the number of the bed which he occupied. The recollections
are at times of service to me, they even afford me instruction,
and occasionally you may hear me refer to them at our bedside
conferences. I therefore urge upon even the youngest among you,
the practice of visiting regularly every day the hospital. On the
whole I believe that you will find it more profitable to give the
preference at first to the medical rather than to the surgical wards....
You will not derive real profit from frequenting the latter
until after you have acquired some knowledge in anatomy, whereas
the possession of a few superficial conceptions regarding physiology
will be found sufficient for the student who is beginning his first
medical studies.</p>

<p class='c018'>Little by little you will find that you are becoming more and
more able to judge, from a mere inspection of the patient’s face
and expression, how serious is the malady with which he is affected;
you will learn how to feel his pulse and to appreciate correctly its
different qualities; and you will begin to acquire some knowledge
of auscultation and percussion; etc....</p>

<p class='c018'>I cannot too often repeat to you the fact that a knowledge of
anatomy is not to be acquired by listening to lectures upon the
subject; in order to gain such knowledge you should have before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>you, a human cadaver—a cadaver around which sit two or three
other students besides yourself, all busily engaged in the work of
dissecting, and near you there should be an older and more experienced
pupil upon whom you can depend for guidance. Similarly,
knowledge of actual disease is to be learned by the student only at
the hospital, and with the aid of one of the resident physicians or
of a chief of staff, who is competent to teach you how a patient
should be questioned and how a systematic examination of the case
should be conducted.... And here let me remind you that the
patients who are to be found in our wards are poor people, people
who are compelled by their suffering and by their lack of money
to take refuge in a hospital. A knowledge of this situation of
affairs should lead us to show them some consideration and respect.
So far as the men are concerned I admit that it is permissible for
us to treat them with less delicacy. From the viewpoint of modesty
there is very little indelicacy in removing the clothes from a man
in order to make an examination of the surface of his body; on the
other hand, it is not right to do this if the examination is at all
likely to affect his health unfavorably. And now that we are discussing
this subject, I am obliged to confess that young men are
only too apt to forget that, after the clothing has been removed
from a man whose skin is wet with perspiration, it is very dangerous
to expose him even for a short time to the contact of a chilly
air. It is also not permissible, even in the interest of science, to
prolong a physical examination or to carry out the manipulations
required in auscultation and percussion if you find that it is exhausting
the poor patient’s strength. In the latter case it is better
to leave the examination incomplete than to increase the feebleness
of a patient who is already in such a state of weakness....</p>

<p>VELPEAU<br />A contemporary of Trousseau and one of France’s most distinguished surgeons.<br /><br />(Copied from a print in the possession of Transylvania College, Lexington, Kentucky.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>It was my intention to introduce at this point a citation
from Trousseau’s “<i>Clinique de l’Hôtel-Dieu</i>” of sufficient
length to reveal fairly well his manner of conducting clinical
instruction at the bedside of a patient. My decision to do
this was based upon the assumption that I should find
among the printed accounts of these supposedly impromptu
lectures one or more which would serve the required purpose.
I soon discovered, however, that not a trace of the
off-hand character of such instruction remained in these
reports. As they appeared in print they were elaborate
and quite exhaustive memoirs, suited for the edification
of men who had already long since passed the undergraduate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>stage of medical training, and I was therefore obliged
to abandon the plan which I had so much desired to carry
out. If I had, from the very first, given more serious
thought to the scheme which I had in mind I would have
quickly realized the fact that no teacher of wide experience
and universally recognized as an authority in the diagnosis
and treatment of disease would be likely to commit to print
lessons which were meant to be useful to medical students
who had only just reached the threshold of their professional
career.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trousseau died on June 23, 1867, in his seventy-second
year. The only important treatises which he published are
the two which I have already mentioned.</p>

Edinburgh Edition printed under the Inspection of Dr. William Cullen. Edinburgh,

I was led to believe that no English version of the “<i>Primae Lineae</i>” exists,

1754 to 1842, becoming, late in life, the Earl of Leicester. He was known
throughout the world of his time as a scientific and accomplished agriculturist.

manner to show their appreciation of the valuable services which these two men
have rendered to medicine: Desault by the important part which he played in
renewing the life and vigor of French Surgery, and Bichat by his untiring efforts,
both by teaching and by research work, to extend the limits of the domain
of Medicine. Successful as were these efforts the results would certainly have
been much greater if death had not put an end to his work before Bichat had
